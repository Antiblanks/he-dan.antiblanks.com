The sound design for Escape The App has been in the back of my mind for quite some time now. A sound to notify the user when a new clue has been made available during game play is (without question in my opinion) absolutely essential being I anticipate the device is likely to be nested in the users pocket most of the time. Aside from this I'd always felt that a score to underpin the game play experience would be good to build intensity and emphasise urgency as time runs down, however I'd anticipated the difficulty of creating something that would compliment the existing ambience of the rooms. I touched on this [here]({% post_url 2019-03-15-week-7-sound-design %}) when I stated that *I should avoid any theme based sounds in the composition being that escape rooms all have their own bespoke themes, and in my experiences throughout my research, the rooms will play continuous ambient sound to accompany their theme which would be testing to compliment and avoid conflicting with which would deliver a bad user experience*. Bearing this in mind I can summarise my initial sound design requirements for MVP into the below statements with intention to expand upon these later during play testing:

- **Composition, underscore, non-diegetic**: I want to create a score to underpin game play that heightens in intensity over the course of the game as the game timer runs down.
- **Sound design, leitmotif or mimetic, diegetic**: I want to create a sound to highlight that a new clue has been made available during game play.
