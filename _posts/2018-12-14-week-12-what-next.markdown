## The brief

Write a 250-300 word post noting your progress so far. Identify one challenge and / or an obstacle and one SMART action to resolve the issue.

## My experience in week eleven

The source material this week was aimed at looking back at what I have learned so far and considering what aims and aspirations I have for the rest of your study.

• Game a week
  - Myth, with time and resources we can make the next best thing but you can't
    - Trying, failing, learning
  - Hard when you have no box to think outside of that box
    - Apply rules, deadlines and constraint (Game a week)
    - Weekly deadline gives you a solid attainable goal
• Prototyping

Ref this somewhere: Adriel Wallick [CDC Game a week presentation](https://archive.org/details/GDCEU2014Wallick)

In this presentation Adriel Wallick speaks about a challenge she faced when she left her job to become an independent game developer, she references how she had so much free time but found it hard to achieve anything of value with this time. Frankly I was very jealous; I don't have a lot of free time, my schedule is already packed full with the day-to-day responsibility of co-running [Antiblanks](http://www.antiblanks,com), being a CTO for various other applications and ventures such as [Plays](http://weareplays.com) and [Roadle](http://www.roadle.co.uk) and trying to be a good husband and father. However I'm not sure it's the amount of time that is important, though I don't anywhere near the time that Adriel Wallick has I can still relate to what she is saying and in my opinion the challenge we both share is not wasting any of the time we have and applying some structure to your time ensures that this is less likely to happen. This is where the SMART actions we've been encouraged to create off the back of our reflection have really helped me. Adriel Wallick talks about how her weekly deadline gives her a *solid attainable goal* and how having this goal of creating a game every week applies pressure onto her to achieve something. I view my SMART actions in the same light...
