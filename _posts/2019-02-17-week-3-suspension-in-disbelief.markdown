## My experience in week three

The source material this week was...

Introduction video:
• Suspension in disbelief, Doug Brown, film/TV tactics into game
• Interplay between thought and interactivity
• Pure solutionism - Really interesting. What we've been doing wrong in the past, reflect on this later
• Vast body of research - Important, what we've been doing wrong in the past, I am already doing this

Ergodic Literature:
• Scripton & Texton - Interesting these and how they feed into the delivery of narrative
• User functions - Interpretative, explorative, configurative etc - Interesting
• Operators, variables, role play, game flow, empowerment to make decisions, changing settings of such premises - Less interesting, done a lot of this, not much learning here but does encourage me think this through deeper for Escape and not just rush through it and rely on my subconcious doing a good job of this

### Tying this to my project

• Going too fast? Goals too lofty? Slow it down perhaps, more consideration in the game mechanics vs getting something into production that can be iterated on?
