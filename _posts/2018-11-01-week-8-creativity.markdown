## The brief

Write a 250-300 word post noting your progress so far. Identify one challenge and / or an obstacle and one SMART action to resolve the issue.

## My experience in week eight

The source material this week was focused on creativity. At first glance I thought the subject would not benefit my current concern which is consumed with fleshing out the viability and monetisation strategy for my Escape Room application. However on consuming the [What is Creativity video on Canvas](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/293/pages/week-8-what-is-creativity?module_item_id=15462), I was pleasantly surprised by how relevant and useful this content was in steering me toward a more considered solution.

In particular the introduction to the term 'stickiness', the term used to define *something about an application that encourages a user to stay longer or return*, and how this can be driven by what Professor Tanya Krzywinska refers to as 'Soap Opera Tactics' that she defines as being *the way you can build stickiness into your app and use creative processes in order to achieve this*, was very insightful. The video then goes on to describe *hook tactics* and *hook structures* that are built into an application to keep an audience interested and willing to subscribe over time and how these strategies should be designed in tandem with monetisation.

* Definition of 'stickiness' taken from the [TechTarget definition of stickiness](https://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/definition/stickiness).

### Tying this to my project

Prior to reading this weeks content I had decided, for the Escape Room application that my monetisation strategy should be based on having a paywall and that the wall is applied at point of adding a room. So users can find and play rooms for free but businesses must subscribe to add their rooms. As a value proposition this works as I would only need to subscribe 1% of the rooms in the UK and US alone (roughly 20,550 rooms) and charge them a very affordable business cost, almost negligible (say less than Â£1.00 / month) which would be viable.

> Note: The subscription cost above needs more evaluation. This will be considered in more depth once I have gauged the interest in the application from escape room businesses and sought information via my audience research outlined in this [post]({% post_url 2018-11-01-week-7-audience-research %}).

This strategy also works well from a marketing point of view because the businesses are pushing the application onto the players to improve their experience. However, this approach rests heavily on one very important factor and this is that the accompanying experience offered to the player by having the app installed must greatly enhance the current analogue experience otherwise the rooms will not be prepared to pay for the subscription.

This is where understanding the audience and creating stickiness with hooks will really bring benefit and (hopefully) drive subscriptions. This AppPartner article titled [The secret to mobile app stickiness](https://www.apppartner.com/secret-mobile-app-stickiness) presents some insightful ways to achieve stickiness and dictates from the outset that *it requires a deep understanding of the end user and the way they interact with the app*. As I touched on above, the SMART action in this [post]({% post_url 2018-11-01-week-7-audience-research %}) will help me to understand the audience and as a follow up to this I've created the following SMART action to derive my strategy to identify the hooks to achieve stickiness:

- **Making it Specific**: ??
- **Making it Measurable**: ??
- **Making it Attainable**: ??
- **Making it Relevant**: ??
- **Making it Time-Based**: ??

## Summary

In the above post I've identified my unfamiliarity with the term 'stickiness'. I've then gone on to outline the steps I've taken to research what this means and better understand ways in which to achieve this within my applications.
