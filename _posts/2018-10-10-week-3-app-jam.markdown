## The brief

This week we are engaging in an *App Jam*; an extreme development practice that *celebrates risky experimentation, and spontaneous creativity*.

The task is to try and create a prototype for an application from beginning to end in only 48 hours; It is mentioned that the short time frame should force us to design a *very small but hopefully very interesting application*.

We should explore new ideas and concepts with hope to discover creativity within ones self and have fun trying out new and interesting ideas. It is mentioned that it's common to perhaps only discover bad ideas, but that we should not be disappointed if we learn only what does not work as failures are equally as important as successes, and we should look at these failings and learn what we need to do next to improve ourselves and our applications.

> Note: It is mentioned that Tim Schafer at Double Fine Studios in San Francisco who have created a range of well known games including Grim Fandango, Psychonauts & Broken Age use Game Jams to recognise and develop new intellectual property and many of their recent games originate from such Game Jams.

Finally mention is given to the importance of finding the time and the space to engage in this practice and that we should *take the activity seriously and plan ahead* if we are to be successful.

TODO...

Spontaneous, far out creative ideas, not be afraid of the idea and allow myself to experiment freely

Interesting divergent designs
