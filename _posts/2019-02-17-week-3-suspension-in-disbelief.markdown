## My experience in week three

The source material this week was...

Introduction video:
• Suspension in disbelief, Doug Brown, film/TV tactics into game
• Interplay between thought and interactivity
• Pure solutionism - Really interesting. What we've been doing wrong in the past, reflect on this later
• Vast body of research - Important, what we've been doing wrong in the past, I am already doing this

Ergodic Literature:
• Cybertexts, cybernetic narratives - (form of Ergodic Literature) Narratives that change when we interact with them
• Scripton & Texton - Interesting these and how they feed into the delivery of narrative
• User functions - Interpretative, explorative, configurative etc - Interesting
• Operators, variables, role play, game flow, empowerment to make decisions, changing settings of such premises - Less interesting, done a lot of this, not much learning here but does encourage me think this through deeper for Escape and not just rush through it and rely on my subconcious doing a good job of this
• CHanging variables altering cybertext (video example)
• References to the decisions made by the user and how these positively affected the outcome (narrative)
• State machines etc, really talking my language but never applied it at this level of complexity
• Traversal mechanisms - Check on what these are?...

An Introduction to Ren'Py:
• Framework used to build interactive visual novels
• Very basic but quite a powerful framework, very procedural, much akin to a console app
TODO: Follow this to setup Ren.Py: https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-3-an-introduction-to-renpy?module_item_id=19039 and do this task: https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/discussion_topics/8375?module_item_id=19043

Pursuing Interactive Suspension of Disbelief
• From his work on Telltale Game's The Walking Dead to the beginnings of their new game at Campo Santo, designer and writer Sean Vanaman explores the challenges encountered and techniques used in creating tonal, emotional, systemic and narrative consistency in the pursuit of suspending a player's disbelief.
• All games based on the same thing:
  - Believable characters
  - Discoverable story
  - Responsive systems
• Stories about people help us to see past our disbelief in the text
• Samuel Taylor Coleridge - Players shouldn't have to ignore certain aspects of the experience just to find narrative or connect to the story
• Do do this:
  - Communicate with the player
  - Focus on the human experience
  - Worth engaging emotionally
• If you're on a date with the player:
  - Get to know them, listen to what they are saying
  - Return with comfortably predictable and excitingly surprising responses
• Dancing with the player
  - Effortless
  - Let the player lead you (check this, who leads?)
• Walking dead and where it failed
  - When the dialog was not as responsive - players eyes glaze, they are experiencing a story but not their story
• Tonal consistency
  - Real conversation
  - Building a relationship
  - Long list of things that will hinder this (see list)
  - Event manager working with speech manager and delivering correct dialog based on state

### Tying this to my project

• State shapes and how this affects the cybernetic narratives
  - How to player decisions affect state and how does this state affect their emergent narrative

• User type and how this affects cybernetic narratives
  - Question up front: 'Are you an XXX or a YYY'

• Start looking as the gamification as a whole and not just the playable element
  - How to we build cybernetic narratives into this?...
  - Who communicates with the user? Who is this person? Think about tonal consistency and narrative cohesion etc
    - Real conversation
    - Building a relationship

• Suspension in disbelief
  - Stories about people help us to see past our disbelief in the text, how can we fine tune our narrative to introduce real people?
  - How to introduce the date scenario into this? Get to know them, listen to what they are saying (audience research) and then give them what they want
  - Think about the responses, the prompts and the hooks, these need to be tailored to the player, they need to feel like their experiencing their own story
  - Don't make it too complicated, make the CTA's easy so that the player can easily lead us through the experience

• Going too fast? Goals too lofty? Slow it down perhaps, more consideration in the game mechanics vs getting something into production that can be iterated on? Reading material always encourages me to put the brakes on, forcing me to think deeper about elements before rushing into implementation, was doing code but parked in favour of working creatively around the narrative and improve it using everything we've learned this week
