## The brief

Write a 250-300 word post noting your progress so far. Identify one challenge and / or an obstacle and one SMART action to resolve the issue.

## My experience in week five

The source material over this week is focused on the different types of application and about the importance and relevance of market research. I found both areas to be very useful.

### Different types of application

Though I knew already what types of application I want to create, I wasn't perhaps aware of the exact terms by which they are identified. Knowing the common name for these categories will enable me to perform more focused market research and competitor analysis on my ideas. To clarify at this point and to tighten my description of the types of app I'm interested in creating that were first mentioned in this [post]({% post_url 2018-10-03-week-2-setup-of-platform-and-tools %}), I can establish that I am most interested in creating *Serious Games* and *Gamification* applications with potential ties into *eHealth / mHealth*.

### Market research

The source material related to market research over this week stands to affirm my already clear understanding of the importance of performing market validation on my application ideas before developing them. Though I was aware of a lot of the content and I have already been practicing most of the techniques raised, the material has helped me to refine my research into a more structured approach and has raised my awareness of a few tips and techniques. Off the back of this I've created a basic checklist below that I will apply to all of my app ideas before developing further past the ideation stage:

- **Market & segmentation**: Establish who is the market, how the market is segmented, which market segments are most relevant to my application idea, what the demographic and technographic characteristics are users in these segments and
• ?
• How are the needs of these segments currently being met?
• Market segmentation is an important factor to consider, does your app fall into a broad or niche, misconception that there is no money in creating apps for a niche
• What niche does my app fit into



- **Relevant marketplace research**: Look at all the app market places for the platforms I want to support; [Apple's App Store](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/app-store) & [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store) and check the chart of the most popular apps for each segmentation of the market, also explore the unpopular apps as well, why have these apps failed? What have users said about the apps?
- **Google search terms**: Google search terms help to highlight if there is interest within a term that relates to your idea
• Pew Global, good place for researching attitudes and trends across a variety of topics, most relevant for the technographic reports that provide information about the technological characteristics of your target audience
- **Find competitor apps**: Look for existing apps doing the same or similar thing as my idea, this just means that you need to better the offer by thinking smart and innovating
- **Analyse the competitor apps**: Use AppTrace gives key data and stats about apps on the market
- **Test the competitor apps**: Competitor testing, research method to assess competitors products through the eyes of the end user and identify issues where the app could be improved, the results of which can go on to inform your idea and your end product

I've created the following SMART action to perform the above checklist on each of the stronger application ideas that I devise in my weekly ideation sessions mentioned in this [post]({% post_url 2018-10-17-week-4-reflection %}):

- **Making it Specific**: The goal is to validate the strongest idea from each ideation session
- **Making it Measurable**: I want to validate all six of the stronger ideas presented by the ideation sessions
- **Making it Attainable**: I want to spread this over six individual one hour long sessions and will schedule these sessions at the same time each week
- **Making it Relevant**: The session will be used to validate ideas before they are considered for development of both of my applications on the course
- **Making it Time-Based**: I want to achieve this in six weeks time

There were two other important learnings from this week that are worthy of mention:

- **Looking for trends in applications**: I hadn't identified this as being a useful starting point for ideation. I've now included this as an additional technique to drive ideas in my weekly ideation sessions already mentioned.
- **Serious game submission criteria in the Apple App Store**: I wasn't aware of the difficulties I would face in getting approval for a *Serious Game* in the Apple App Store. Being this is one of my favoured application types I need to have a thorough understanding of the criteria and be mindful of this when developing my ideas. I have created a one hour long diary entry next week to digest this criteria.

## Summary

In this post I've clarified the common names for the types of application that I am interested in creating. I've also demonstrated my understanding of the importance of market research in creating successful applications, and I've outlined a checklist to test my application ideas for market viability that has then been used as the basis for a SMART action to ensure all of my application ideas are validated.
