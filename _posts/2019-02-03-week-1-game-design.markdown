## My experience in week one

As the title suggests, the source material this week was about Game Design. Being the first week back after the Christmas break it was a light introduction to pave the way for the focus of this module which will be to armour us with knowledge and skills we need to create games and applications which we can apply to our project over the next twelve weeks.

The [Welcome video](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-1-introduction?module_item_id=19009) by Alcwyn Parker opens with a piece about *Creativity and the Agile Mind* and likened creativity to gymnastics in that the creative mind needs plenty of practice and training to become more agile and thus more creative. The video references the *fixed* and *growth* mindset and how improving mental agility with practice will only work if you have a growth mindset. The purpose of this introduction being to encourage us to approach each week within this module with a growth mindset and to develop our abilities through dedication and hard work. Something I very much intend to do of course.

The [Introduction to Game Design video](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-1-an-introduction-to-game-design?module_item_id=19013) by Dom Starr was super interesting. Though I've been fortunate enough to work on numerous games during my professional career including, 'Bucks Flying Adventure', a 3D first person flying game I created nearly a decade ago for Ice Age 3 and more recently 'Smashing Virus', a 3D first person Shoot 'Em Up I built in 2017 as an immersive experience for a pharmaceutical expo in Abu Dhabi, nothing I have worked on has been as part of a large scale team so the disciplines covered and the iterative pattern of development were new concepts to me, and ones that I found great joy in learning about. Specifically I was interested in the depth of consideration that goes into a game at a higher level and the separation of responsibilities between the systems, level, content, narrative and UI designers and then how these creatives work with one another in a very agile manor to achieve the end result. What's interesting is that I can draw parallels with the smaller games I've created as I can see what roles I've had to play in order to create them.

### Tying this to my project

Despite having enjoyed the reading this week, arriving back to the course after Christmas to discover the content was heavily aimed at the creation games was initially a touch worrying. When I think of games, I think of these in the more literal 'arcade style game' and having proactively prepared myself toward the end of last year and even more so over the last four weeks to get stuck into development of 'Escape The App', (last referred to as 'Escape Room' in this [post]({% post_url 2018-12-14-week-12-what-next %})) I was concerned that I might be forced to park this for twelve weeks and that the work I'd been doing was not going to be relevant which was not the news I was hoping for.

Thankfully my concerns were alleviated when it was confirmed on Thursday's webinar that a gamification app (like 'Escape The App') would be relevant as my development project for this module (*Hallelujah*). To be frank I couldn’t be more relieved about this, I'd really got behind 'Escape The App' since December and thrown myself into more in-depth market and audience research in order to first flex the idea’s viability as a business by understanding in great detail the market size, growth over the last five years and any other relevant metrics from player, business and financial statistics to construct a near complete business plan, and just one week ago, go on to seek proof of my hypothesis that 'Escape Game enthusiasts want to know the best times recorded to escape the rooms they play and try to beat them' by creating this [landing page](https://www.escapetheapp.com/) which targeting related search terms on Google in the London area has yielded **107 clickthroughs** over **3000 impressions** with over **15-20% of those signing up for updates about the app**. Being the objective in my business plan was to secure 3% (836,000) of my Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) I was feeling pleased with those results and keen to start development of the app. On top of the research, as per my SMART actions and sprint planning from from last year I have created wireframes for the key journey's within the app and I did spend a couple of weeks over the Christmas period expanding the abstract components within my various React Native boilerplates so that I could hit the ground running with development in 2019.  

In short, things are moving along nicely with 'Escape The App' and I'm very excited about spending the next twelve weeks developing the MVP as planned. One area for improvement though, which has been highlighted by this weeks study is that I should approach all aspects of the game design (including the mechanic, the narrative, the UX / UI and the design) with a bit more agility and try to adopt the iterative development approach of design, prototyping and evaluation mentioned in the Introduction to Game Design video, complimenting this with audience research, to get right under the skin of the playable part of the application to deliver a better end result that will (hopefully) captivate my users and keep them returning for more.
