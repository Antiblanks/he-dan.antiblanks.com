## The brief

Write a 250-300 word post noting your progress so far. Identify one challenge and / or an obstacle and one SMART action to resolve the issue.

## My experience in week nine

The source material this week was focused on the importance of adopting new and current technologies in empowering creativity and how this can be used to diverge from established genre patterns and create disruptive apps. Some AI app examples are given which (as stated by this DataFloq article titled [The Top 7 Technology Trends for 2018](https://datafloq.com/read/the-top-7-technology-trends-for-2018/4085) is very current in 2018 technology trends, there is also an example where genetic algorithms were used to make non-player characters behave more like humans and further interesting examples where the creators are in each case pushing the boundaries of a technology and in doing so highlighting themselves as experts in that piece of tech.

Though in each case it was very inspiring to listen to how the creator is using the technology, the understanding of just how important it is to adopt new and emerging tech was not new to me; having worked for [Substance Global](https://www.substanceglobal.com) as a senior programmer developing Flash games to support online marketing campaigns for Film clients such as [20th Century Fox](http://www.fox.co.uk) and [Metro Goldwyn Mayer](https://www.mgm.com), and more recently with high profile pharmaceutical clients to deliver applications for use at trade shows, I have first-hand experience that clients like these mentioned are attracted to emerging tech in order to market products. The reason for this is simply that people are interested in *new things* that they haven't seen before. This was reinforced for me recently when I worked with Neil Smith from [Leo Associates](https://www.leoassociates.com) to develop a Microsoft Kinect powered application for a pharmaceutical company to be used at a trade show in Abu Dhabi; when I was quizzing Neil on what his clients in other sectors such as aviation and automotive want from applications for their installations he told me that above all his clients are looking for:

> The next *big thing* in technology to make their installation stand out and create a talking point.

The effect on users of adopting an emerging technology can be seen in mobile apps and games too, take the success of [Pokemon Go!](https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-go) that was partially due to their early adoption of modern AR technology. This is great use case to illustrate how the creator has tapped into a new technology, utilised it well, done things that nobody else has done before and in turn created a novel and innovative app that had earlier this year made over $1.8 billion to date.

### Tying this to my project

Previously identified during the App Jam that not being ready to develop with AR held me back and prevented me from exploring the strongest idea for the AR driven Escape Room application that I have since gone on to consider as the app I will develop on the course. As a result of this I realised the need to be ready to develop applications with new technology and in this [post](2018-10-17-week-4-reflection) on reflection in week four I created a SMART action to integrate both AR and VR as forks of my React Native boilerplate. Upon further reflection during this week I realise that

Going beyond this application I need to **<<TODO>>**

I’ve created a SMART action to ensure I’m ready to develop applications with emerging tech:
• Specific: The goal is to create forks of my current React Native boilerplate to integrate various emerging technologies, so I can easily develop against these.
• Measurable: For each piece of technology that interests me, I want to have a forked boilerplate in my Github repository that is ready to develop against.
• Attainable: I’ve already forked the boilerplate to integrate Google Maps and various Firebase libraries so I know the effort required and can manage integrating one technology alongside my regular two week sprint.
• Relevant: One or more forked boilerplates will potentially be used for one of my applications on the course or thereafter. I should be able to combine them easily to create the bare bones of an app which requires each chosen tech.
• Time-Based: I want to have either AR or VR integrated into a forked boilerplate by the time we restart the course in the new year.
