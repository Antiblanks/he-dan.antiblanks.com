## The brief

This week we are engaging in an app jam; an extreme development practice that *celebrates risky experimentation, and spontaneous creativity*.

The task is to try and create a prototype for an application from beginning to end in only 48 hours; It is mentioned that the short time frame should force us to design a *very small but hopefully very interesting application*.

We should explore new ideas and concepts with hope to discover creativity within ones self and have fun trying out new and interesting ideas. It is mentioned that it's common to perhaps only discover bad ideas, but that we should not be disappointed if we learn only what does not work as failures are equally as important as successes, and we should look at these failings and learn what we need to do next to improve ourselves and our applications.

> Note: It is mentioned that Tim Schafer at Double Fine Studios in San Francisco who have created a range of well known games including Grim Fandango, Psychonauts & Broken Age use Game Jams to recognise and develop new intellectual property and many of their recent games originate from such Game Jams.

There is mention given to the importance of finding the time and the space to engage in this practice and that we should *take the activity seriously and plan ahead* if we are to be successful.

Finally, there is a theme for the app jam which has been selected using Verb, Noun & Adjective (VNA) ideation cards and this is *Guide, Opponent, Restricted*.

### Understanding the brief

This task is about identifying ideas and validating them through rapid prototyping and eventually developing a stronger idea into a more polished prototype.

In order to uncover better ideas I should allow myself to be spontaneous in brainstorming and not be fearful of allowing myself to experiment freely.

I should try to work in cycles to ideate, select an idea, and then construct prototypes to validate the idea. I should select methods that enable me to reduce the time required for each iteration and maximise the number of cycles I can complete in order to fail quickly and move on. Anything I can do to reduce time in validating an idea early will help me to arrive at a stronger end piece. To be more efficient, my mind maps, wire frames and early prototypes should be sketched and not polished and I should test in a concise and focused manor.

Understanding the time constraints from the outset are important; 48 hours is not long, the project will need to be managed effectively and broken apart to illustrate the different elements required in the overall task. I will need to time box each element effectively and stick closely to plan. In order to get the most from the task I should allocate larger dedicated blocks of time where I have little distraction to maintain focus.

## My approach

I'm going to break my jam into three parts:

### Part 1: Identifying ideas

This part has been designed to promote spontaneous creativity and experimentation with ideas to identify various potential avenues for exploration. Tasks will include:

- **Ideation**: (4 hours) Brainstorm and create mind maps to highlight potential ideas based on the theme. I will use a combination of the *problem & solution* and *theme and story* approach to ideating.

### Part 2: Selecting an idea and developing it

This part has been designed to select a stronger idea from the step above and then rapidly develop the idea to identify whether the idea is worthy of further development. Tasks will include:

- **Selecting an idea**: (1 hour) Select a stronger idea and create a mind map to explore the idea further.
- **Sketching & paper prototyping**: (1 hour) Sketch rough wire frames of key screens to form user journeys and present these to show how the user would interact.
- **Critiquing the paper prototyping**: (1 hour) Test the idea by walking through the paper prototype with an impartial third party and gathering feedback.

### Part 3: Developing the final idea

This part has been designed to focus on the strongest idea and develop it further to provide a working programmatic prototype of the core application feature. Tasks will include:

- **Sketched digital prototyping**: (4 hours) Take the sketches into prototyping software such as [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) and create an interactive prototype to illustrate a vertical or horizontal slice of the application.
- **Designed digital prototyping**: (8 hours) Convert the sketches into more polished art work using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and import these into the InVision prototype.
- **Programmatic prototyping**: (16 hours) Demonstrate the core of the application as a coded prototype using the appropriate platform and tools.

### Intent and project management

My intention is to ideate only once at the beginning (*Part 1*), and then select three ideas to develop and prototype rapidly in cycles (*Part 2*), and finally select the strongest idea for developing further into a programmatic prototype (*Part 3*).

I am going to work in eight dedicated sessions, each with a set time and goal, the sessions will be broken down to support the above approach. Below is my session plan:

## Session 1: Identifying ideas

I started this session by brainstorming various meanings of each of the words in the theme *Guide, Opponent, Restricted*. My intention was just to warm up my creativity and start to highlight potential terms for expansion.

### Terms related to the word *Guide*

### Terms related to the word *Opponent*

### Terms related to the word *Restricted*

### Combining terms to create stories

Next I started to combine some of the stronger terms in each brainstorm to construct ideas for potential themes and stories on which to base my application. What I found interesting here is that the majority of my ideas were for games or at least had some gamification element, after saying only last week that *I am not a big gamer* in my [post about platforms and tools]({% post_url 2018-10-03-week-2-setup-of-platform-and-tools %})... Maybe I misjudged myself?!

| Guide | Opponent | Restricted
| ---- | ---- |
| A patient toward something | A disease or illness | By how far he/she can go without medication
| Audio instruction | Blindness | By sight that is worsening
| Example of shape to copy | Other player | By number of attempts
| Light at the end of a tunnel | An enemy | By the walls of a tunnel
| Girl guide wants badges | Other player/s | By the rules to be awarded a badge
| Speed signs | Police / speed cameras | By minimum or maximum speed
| Guiding a missile | A target | By different factors that affect direction
| Guiding a metal object | Magnets pushing or pulling | By the space between the magnets which are getting closer together
| Instructions | Time limit | By being stuck in a room

### Developing the narrative for each combination of terms

Next I studied the above table of combined terms and began to expand the stories around some of the stronger combinations. The following is a list of potential application ideas based on this process, I've tried to pick very different ideas to get a nice variation for selection:

- **Sick Steve**: A game aimed at adults for amusement - Sick Steve has been infected by a deadly virus that will kill him. Using your finger you need to keep Steve upright and moving forwards to guide him down corridors, paths and streets to find the medication he so badly needs. As time goes by Steve's condition worsens and he becomes harder to keep upright. If you hit the left/right sides then Steve will fall and die.
- **Shape maker**: A game aimed at all ages but more so at children for learning to mark make - Players are challenged to copy a shape which is drawn for them as a guide by the computer. Shapes drawn are judged on accuracy and how closely they resemble the guide shape. The shapes start easy (a circle) and get more and more difficult to replicate as the game progresses. Players can play against themselves or against others.
- **Speed awareness application**: A challenge game aimed at adults to raise awareness of speeding - Players are shown a speed-o-meter that they need to keep between a restricted minimum and maximum number by moving their finger up and down a scale to raise or lower their speed. The speed of the vehicle is affected by factors such as terrain, gradient and weather conditions. The target speed changes regularly and is indicated by signs that will appear to guide the player. Players can play against themselves or against others.
