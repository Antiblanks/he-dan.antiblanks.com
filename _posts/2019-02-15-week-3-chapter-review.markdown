## The brief

Complete a chapter review of Dr Douglas Brown's thesis, *The suspension of disbelief in video games*.

## Defining suspension of disbelief

I've chosen to read and review *Chapter 2 – Defining suspension of disbelief*.

## Chapter review

1. **The key point discussed by the author: is this clearly defined?**

What is suspension of disbelief, what does it mean, first the terminology itself and then the what it is actually describing.

57-64 Exploring the term 'suspension of disbelief':
* Presents when the term was coined and by whom
* References lots of works by various sources and authors where the term itself has been analysed and debated, looking at many understandings of what the term suspension of disbelief means.

Opening paragraph:
• Sets the scene for the point of discussion in the chapter.
• Brief summary of the content preceding this chapter.
• A sentence on what analysis is required to answer the question XYZ and why this chapter is relevant...
• Brief summary of what this chapter intends to achieve in that we will understand what is meant by suspension in disbelief

Next:
• Presentation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth
• Definition of a phase which is described as the de facto referent for the concept
• Likens their work but suggests both subjects are approaching the same idea from different directions
• Analysis of Coleridge's works including his collection of poems *Lyrical Ballads* written with William Wordsworth and the poem *Kubla Khan* used to introduce us to framing passages or prefaces that the author uses to acclimatise the reader for the poem
• Suggestion that the poems themselves only works as well as they do with the preface and how the switch between the two constitutes the suspension of disbelief. The author writes: 'In Kubla Khan, Coleridge crowbars the reader into the position of the dreamer' which he describes as being 'the location from which suspension of disbelief comes most naturally'

2. What evidence has the author produced to support this central idea?

• References of different works by different authors who in some way analyse the term 'Suspension of disbelief'
  • Huizinga - discussion of poetry and summary of *Person from Porlock*
  • Roland Barthes' - notion of the 'Death of the author'
  • Robert Hodge and David Tripp - media effects debate
  • Ferri - ?
