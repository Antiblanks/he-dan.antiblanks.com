## My experience in week three

The source material this week was...

Introduction video:
• Suspension in disbelief, Doug Brown, film/TV tactics into game
• Interplay between thought and interactivity
• Pure solutionism - Really interesting. What we've been doing wrong in the past, reflect on this later
• Vast body of research - Important, what we've been doing wrong in the past, I am already doing this

Ergodic Literature:
• Cybertexts, cybernetic narratives - (form of Ergodic Literature) Narratives that change when we interact with them
• Scripton & Texton - Interesting these and how they feed into the delivery of narrative
• User functions - Interpretative, explorative, configurative etc - Interesting
• Operators, variables, role play, game flow, empowerment to make decisions, changing settings of such premises - Less interesting, done a lot of this, not much learning here but does encourage me think this through deeper for Escape and not just rush through it and rely on my subconcious doing a good job of this
• CHanging variables altering cybertext (video example)
• References to the decisions made by the user and how these positively affected the outcome (narrative)
• State machines etc, really talking my language but never applied it at this level of complexity
• Traversal mechanisms - Check on what these are?...

An Introduction to Ren'Py:
• Framework used to build interactive visual novels
• Very basic but quite a powerful framework, very procedural, much akin to a console app
TODO: Follow this to setup Ren.Py: https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-3-an-introduction-to-renpy?module_item_id=19039



### Tying this to my project

• Going too fast? Goals too lofty? Slow it down perhaps, more consideration in the game mechanics vs getting something into production that can be iterated on?

• State shapes and how this affects the cybernetic narratives
  - How to player decisions affect state and how does this state affect their emergent narrative

• User type and how this affects cybernetic narratives
  - Question up front: 'Are you an XXX or a YYY'

• Start looking as the gamification as a whole and not just the playable element
  - How to we build cybernetic narratives into this?...
