## My experience in week two

The source material this week was about TODO...

### Tying this to my project

Despite itching to throw myself into the development of Escape The App, I had planned to finish the app's business plan by the start of February so that I could begin pitching for investment by the middle to the end of the month. Despite being behind in achieving this goal, I also acknowledge that the development required to bring the app to MVP release over the next eleven weeks is no mean feat in itself so I decided to split my week 50/50 with aim to move both tasks side by side.

• TODO: Business plan stuff here... What went right, what went wrong... Realising that the advisor should be the primary investor, defining who this might be (owner of several businesses spread across the UK and why...), hindered by calculating the Return On Investment (ROI), enforcing a conclusion I'd already arrived at, that Escape The App is not an *insanely* profitable venture when pegged against the likes of [Plays](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plays-animate-your-messages/id1346642927) (for example), an app in MVP release for which I am the CTO and for which boasts a much greater ROI, primarily because of the huge audience, and to investors this app was a much more advantageous proposition. The reality is that Escape The App is quite the opposite, within the current market it is a conservative investment opportunity in comparison, however the Escape Games Industry is a young market and it's growing rapidly and currently no one is servicing the demand for an app of this kind from the Escape Game Enthusiasts. Based on this, if Escape The App is first to market, is adopted by the enthusiasts and the market continues to grow as predicted over the next three years, then the ROI in three years might actually be far greater than I can calculate from today's Serviceable Attainable Market (SAM). To summarise, the challenge with Escape The App is that it might be hard to find investment without those big *eye popping* ROI numbers and the fact that there is risk in that the Escape Games market might not grow as well as predicted. For this reason I've decided to look for primary investment within the industry because the investor will better understand the potential and demand for this product.

• TODO: UX and development stuff here, Talk about finishing up the UX for the play experience and how it maps closely the existing experience, talk about how this needs iteration to ensure it compensates for all manor of games, talk about the Firebase DB setup and structure, getting my head around a NoSQL DB and the document data structure and integrating the finished schema into the app to provide data for the...

• Anyway, I've digressed, what I learned this week from the source material is XYZ and this is how I'm going to use this knowledge to better Escape The App. TODO...

• Narrative:
  2012: Real-world social interactions and dying. Millenials are increasingly turning to their devices to play virtual games above  
  Fearful of real-world problem solvers becoming extinct
  In an effort to draw gamers away from their computers to interact in the real world the government formed a top secret underground movement known as Escape
  Their objective was to flood our world with Escape Games
