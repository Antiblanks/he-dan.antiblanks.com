## My experience in week seven

The source material this week was focused on the theory and practice of sound design.

The [Introduction Video by Alcwyn Parker](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-7-introduction?module_item_id=19086) gives a brief overview of sound design. The video opens to state that *the importance of this multifaceted and complex specialism is often overlooked* and I completely agree; in the four (or so) years I spent building online games I cannot recall one game that had it's own bespoke sound recording, in fact, if I recall correctly, all of the games I built had sound tagged on afterwards and the sound was acquired from a stock library with cost-cutting being at the heart of the decision. The video emphasises the importance of sound design and suggests that, when done right, sound design can *enhance the usability of your app and create more meaningful interactions with the user*. The video then gives some examples of how we can add sound to our apps, stock libraries (as I mentioned above) being one of these, but we are warned off from using stock sound being that it *wonâ€™t be as relevant to the overall aesthetic* of our apps and that the originality of our apps *may be diminished somewhat*.

We are then introduced to a paper from 1985 titled 'Earcons and Icons: Their Structure and Common Design Principles' which describes earcons as "nonverbal audio messages used in the user-computer interface to provide information to the user about some computer object, operation, or interaction" (1), and breaks these into two types *representational* which aim to resemble the interaction in some way and *abstract* which are derived from sets of pitches that are said to form motives, where a motive is defined as a "brief succession of pitches arranged to produce a rhythmic and tonal pattern sufficiently distinct to allow it to function as an individual, recognisable entity." (1). The former *representational* being very simple for me to understand but the later by name being more *abstract*. We are given advice about the length of an earcon which *should be sufficient to convey the message effectively, and no longer* and that *the meaning must come across as quickly and as easily as possible* and we are given the paper as reference for further reading with a closing statement to the section which announces the relevance of reading the paper, despite its age.

The video then touches on how modern sound design has moved on from this and how recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and speech recognition have caused a rise in voice-controlled intelligent personal assistant devices, forcing us as app developers to question traditional interface paradigms and consider what an app design looks like when the Graphical User Interface (GUI) is removed. Considering this myself is important being to ensure that Escape The App's playable element remains non-intrusive I will have to rely heavily on sound to notify the user of changing events that are taking place while the device is nested in the users pocket.

The video then closes with some sound design considerations posed by Hugo Verweij, a sound designer at Apple, who prompts us to question how the UI can benefit from an audible component, suggesting it is vital to find a balance and ensure that all audio is meaningful, and whether sound can play a role in our app's branding which he suggests we should consider from the outset.

Fundamentals of audio for games
Game audio split into 3 distinct areas combined to give the final product
  - Composition - Composition of an engaging score making the player experience more immersive & control mood based on progression and situation.
  - Sound design - Used to present action on screen such as gun shots etc
  - Adaptive elements - Relates to both, implemented using programs such as FMod or WWise described on this [Youtube Instructional Video on Adding Sound with FMod and WWise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7pL4_yN7RY) as sound middleware programs, summarised as sounds that adapt to changes
Looking into the above in more detail
  - Underscores - Musical background that underpins the action on screen
  - Leitmotifs - Musical phrase assigned to a character or scene
  - Adaptive elements - Shifting changes to the underscore based on game or player conditions or playing a certain leitmotif when a character enters the screen
Sound effects / sound affects
  - Importance of good sound effect and sonic design
  - Divide sonic elements in sound design into two basic descriptives
    - Diegetic sound - Sounds that relate directly to what we are seeing on screen
    - Non-diegetic sound - Sounds that do not relate directly to action on screen, used for ambience and scene setting
The sounds we use
  - Stock
  - Recorded for true originality
  - Unpacking the various techniques available for recording sound including field recording and foley sounds, synthesis and mimetic sound


The [Foley and Found Sound content](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-7-foley-and-found-sound?module_item_id=19091) XXX

Demonstrates the depth to which foley sound can be created, the particularities involved and how far people are willing to go to be more precise to add more production value and deliver a more convincing experience

### Tying this to my project

Don't want to overlook this element
create more meaningful interactions with the user
Sound is important in Escape The App... Images not working
Earcons and Icons, will require both representational and abstract sounds
Task to Experiment with sounds that might work to capture the essence of the functionality of the app in this [post]({% post_url 2019-03-16-week-7-experimenting-with-sounds %})

Composition - probably should avoid being the rooms have their own ambient sounds and this could be jarring and create a bad user experience
Sound design - will need to

Leitmotif - Could use for the games master
Diegetic sound - During game play any action on screen should have a diegetic sound attached to it, these would be XXX

The sounds we use - Stock probably sufficient for Escape The App, would be nice to experiment with recording my own sounds but not sure if this product requires that depth being XXX, useful to know the techniques available for exploration in future when building XXX
