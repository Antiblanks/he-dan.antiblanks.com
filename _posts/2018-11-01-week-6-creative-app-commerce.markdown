## The brief

Write a 250-300 word post noting your progress so far. Identify one challenge and / or an obstacle and one SMART action to resolve the issue.

## My experience in week six

The source material over this week is focused on commercial aspects of creative apps. Specifically funding and monetisation models, the importance of unique selling points, the content required in a pitch to investors, how to analyse and present information to a business audience and the typical contents of a business plan.

As has been the case in most weeks on the course so far, I do have first hand industry experience in all of the areas mentioned, but as usual the weeks research has made me realise that my process has gaps and devoting a week to study in this area has helped to bring further insight into my practice and enabled me to unify my understanding and make it more relevant to the types of app I am interested in creating.

### Tying this to my project

It was always intended that I would exit the course with one, if not two viable IPs and since joining I have been searching for the first strong idea to move forward with. As my existing SMART actions denote, I have been taking the time to regularly ideate each week for the last two weeks and though I would like more time to happen upon an idea, I felt that being we are coming to the end of week six, I should get behind one of my existing ideas if I am to stand a chance of creating an MVP of the application before the end of the module. For this reason I have decided to begin further exploration into the 'Escape Room' idea surfaced in the App Jam.

One of my intentions was always to construct a business plan and a investment pitch document for each of the applications I create on the course and also to go out and seek investment alongside development to further the applications outside the realm of study. With this in mind I see the next seven to eight weeks being used to create my MVP for 'Escape Room' and to produce the material required to seek investment to develop this further.

I've created the following SMART actions to support this:

**Creating a business plan**

- **Making it Specific**: ?
- **Making it Measurable**: ?
- **Making it Attainable**: ?
- **Making it Relevant**: ?
- **Making it Time-Based**: ?

**Creating an investor pitch document**
