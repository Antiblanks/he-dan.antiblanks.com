## My experience in week eleven

The source material this week is focused on rigging 3D assets and then making simple animations. Again this is an area that I am very interested in and one where I have little experience, but being that this is a continuation from the exploration into 3D asset creation in week ten, and that the MVP of Escape The App does not need any 3D animation until I develop the Augmented Reality (AR) based playable game feature for V1 of the app, I am going to skip over the content in this week and look to revisit this when I come to developing V1.

### Tying this to my project

I could see from lightly skimming over the weeks content

Activity: take the 3D icon or logo from the output of last week's activity and animate it in a way that is appropriate for your app
