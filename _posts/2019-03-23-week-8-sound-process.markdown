## My experience in week eight

The source material this week was focused on the fundamental building blocks of sound through the lens of sound synthesis.

The [Introduction Video by Alcwyn Parker](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-8-introduction?module_item_id=19099) describes the term sound synthesis as being *the practice of generating sound from scratch* and suggests that there are two strands of sound synthesis:

- **Recreating real-world acoustic sounds**
- **Creation of new sounds with unique and other-worldly timbres**

The video goes on to introduce us to a text by Andy Farnell called *Designing Sound* giving a quote from his book that champions sound synthesis in saying that *sounds constructed are more realistic and useful than recordings because they capture behaviour*, and describes Farnell's suggestion that there are three pillars of designing for sounds, these being physics, mathematics and psychology.

The video summarises the relationship between programming and sound synthesis and introduces us to live-coding and algorave, as well as .
