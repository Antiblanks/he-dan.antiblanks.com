## My experience in week three

The source material this week was...

• Suspension in disbelief, Doug Brown, film/TV tactics into game
• Interplay between thought and interactivity
• Pure solutionism - Really interesting. What we've been doing wrong in the past, reflect on this later 

### Tying this to my project

• Going too fast? Goals too lofty? Slow it down perhaps, more consideration in the game mechanics vs getting something into production that can be iterated on?
