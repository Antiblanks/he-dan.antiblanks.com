## The brief

Complete a chapter review of Dr Douglas Brown's thesis, *The suspension of disbelief in video games*.

## Defining suspension of disbelief

I've chosen to read and review *Chapter 2 – Defining suspension of disbelief*.

## Chapter review

1. **The key point discussed by the author: is this clearly defined?**

What is suspension of disbelief, what does it mean, first the terminology itself and then the what it is actually describing.

57-64 Exploring the term 'suspension of disbelief':
* Presents when the term was coined and by whom
* References lots of works by various sources and authors where the term itself has been analysed and debated, looking at many understandings of what the term suspension of disbelief means.

Opening paragraph:
• Sets the scene for the point of discussion in the chapter.
• Brief summary of the content preceding this chapter.
• A sentence on what analysis is required to answer the question XYZ and why this chapter is relevant...
• Brief summary of what this chapter intends to achieve in that we will understand what is meant by suspension in disbelief

Next:
• Presentation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth
• Definition of a phase which is described as the de facto referent for the concept
• Likens their work but suggests both subjects are approaching the same idea from different directions
• Analysis of Coleridge's works including his collection of poems *Lyrical Ballads* written with William Wordsworth and the poem *Kubla Khan* used to introduce us to framing passages or prefaces that the author uses to acclimatise the reader for the poem
• Suggestion that the poems themselves only works as well as they do with the preface and how the switch between the two constitutes the suspension of disbelief. The author writes: 'In Kubla Khan, Coleridge crowbars the reader into the position of the dreamer' which he describes as being 'the location from which suspension of disbelief comes most naturally'

2. What evidence has the author produced to support this central idea?

• References of different works by different authors who in some way analyse the term 'Suspension of disbelief'
  • Huizinga - discussion of poetry and summary of *Person from Porlock*
  • Roland Barthes' - notion of the 'Death of the author'
  • Robert Hodge and David Tripp - media effects debate
  • Ferri - ?
  • Iser - ?
  • Wayne Booth - ?
  • Gerrig - ?
  • Perren & Arsenault - ?
  • Kant - ?
  • Holland - ?
  • Brian Sutton Smith - ?
  • JRR Tolkien - ?
  • Hall - ?
  • Lindley & Brown - ?

3. How convincing are the reasons given to the author’s point of view?

• The inclusion of references are convincing
• The depth of analysis and the heavy use of references from many credible authors

4. Could the evidence be interpreted in other ways?

•

5. What is the author's research method (e.g. qualitative, quantitative,
experimental)?

• Definitely Qualitative Research based/formed by reading a bulk of works on the subject by many different authors and analysing their opinions

6. What is the author's theoretical framework (e.g. psychological, developmental,
feminist)?

• ?

7. What is the relationship assumed by the author between theory and practice?

• ?

8. Has the author critically evaluated the other literature in the field?

• Yes very much so, 57-64 exploring many views on the term 'suspension of disbelief'
• 68 throwing idea into jeopardy
• 69 catharsis clash
• 70 cautions against it, questioned the positioning, if not the spirit of suspension of disbelief (Tolkien's objection)
• 71-72 Tolkien and Coleridge opposed

9. Does the author include literature opposing her / his point of view?

• Hard to find the authors point of view initially being that the first half of the chapter is more of an exploration of the meaning based on the opinions of various credible sources and not the authors opinion of the meaning
• The author's point of view starts to emerge around page 73 into the later half of the chapter...

10. Is the research data valid i.e. based on a reliable method and accurate
information?

• Not sure this is relevant?...

11. Can you 'deconstruct' the argument – identify the gaps or jumps in the logic?

• ?

12. What are the strengths and limitations of this study?

• Strengths
  - Broad opinion research into many credible authors and consideration of a large number of differing opinions

13. What does this book or article contribute to my own work?*

• Deeper understanding of what it means to suspend disbelief and assistance in forming a more comprehensive and considered strategy for doing this in my application/s based on various other opinions on the subject
• Potential inclusion of a carefully crafted introduction or preface to acclimatise the player into the game
• Tolkien's use of maps and annotations and how these can be used to realise fictional worlds is inspiring in the sense of understanding that it is these pieces that help to glue the narrative together and deeper immerse the player into the world you are creating for them giving them context of the world you are describing. This makes me wonder whether there is some way I can glue the escape games together as missions, potentially to be succeeded in a specific order with a graphical representation of ones progress. Games upon games. The idea that a more holistic game could be introduced?...
• Passivity or failure to react quickly enough to the cues provided by the text is one of the most common mechanics for failure and restarting games
