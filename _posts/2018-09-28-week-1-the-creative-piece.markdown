## The brief

This is a creative task, and one that involves rapid ideation to present an idea for a new concept of an application on the forum.

The requirement is to explore ideas about what the application could be, then describe the application, illustrate it and provide sufficient detail.

The following techniques were mentioned and should be included to demonstrate the idea and my thinking: Mind maps, rough drawings, diagrams & mock ups.

Finally there is a constraint. The application needs to be based around a theme and this is the idea that *As long as we have each other we will never run out of problems*.

> Note: It was mentioned that this was the theme for the [Global Game JAM](https://globalgamejam.org/) in 2009

### Understanding the brief

I feel that this task is about allowing myself to think and not procrastinate for too long, but instead to open my mind to new ideas and in the process (hopefully) uncover something of value - An idea that could have a place in today's landscape.

In the introduction video there is mention about the small number of ideas that are 'actualised' and then the even smaller number that are 'successful'. This leads me to believe that this task is about quickly identifying ideas, but just as quickly discounting these ideas if there is felt to be no place in the market for such an application.

To be successful in this task I will need to work 'rapidly' and allow myself to be creative without letting too many constraints stifle my thinking. I will need to time box each component and know when to stop in order to get the most value from the entire process and not fall short.

### My approach

## Summary

In this post I've ...

## What's next?...

There is potential for this application to be successful and thus scope to further the idea. I've briefly validated the need for an application of this nature and proven the size of the market place but there is far more in-depth research required into whether OCD sufferers would **actually** use this application; I would need to research the different experiences that people have with the disorder to understand how the app should be structured and the content that should appear.

The solution I currently proposed needs a lot more validation before it could be actualised. On top of the this, I would need to prove some value proposition - It's all well and good helping people and if I can create something that betters peoples lives that is a huge positive but the application will need to be funded; who would invest (the government?) and could this application actually be taken past point of actualisation to being successful?

Finally, just from a practical point of view, I would need to create an investment pitch deck to present the idea in a more compelling way and to take the idea to potential investors.
