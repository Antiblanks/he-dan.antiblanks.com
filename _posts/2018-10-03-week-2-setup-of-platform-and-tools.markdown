## The brief

This week we've been tasked with the setup and configuration of the tools we need to start making applications. As stated in the introduction video we need to *identify a small selection of tools which will aid us in our field of interest*, and then we need to *set up and configure the tools we need to create an app*.

We should consider relevant languages, integrated environments, version control systems, software development kits (SDKs) for key platforms, and other computer aided software engineering systems.

We've been steered to *pick the right tool based on the nature of the app/s you want to create*, and to *concentrate on the tools that are relevant to the apps you want to make*.

It is identified in the brief that *the challenge is knowing you cannot master everything*.

### Understanding the brief

The brief this week is incredibly assistive in guiding us through this task. The advice to pick the right tool based on the nature of the application/s you want to create is paramount and this should be the first thing to consider.

As it states, and as I am more than aware already, there are numerous platforms and tools to choose from. We've been given the hint *not to try and master everything*. This is a key statement that should resonate when approaching this task, being mindful of this throughout will prevent me getting caught in the trap of tinkering too much with different systems.

Another thing to consider is falling foul of focusing on the newest and coolest tech. I've seen it so many times in my career where developers can flit between technologies (and jobs) because they are driven by shiny new ways of doing things which are exciting. I understand it's exciting to work with a new technology but it's important to understand when a technology becomes viable for selection - By all means we should try out anything and everything as soon as it gets announced but we should be mindful of the fact that the technology we embrace will have *bugs*, will lack support documentation, and if that technology does stand the test of time (which it might not), will likely be re-versioned dramatically and improved so much that later versions are not backwards compatible and your application could quickly become outdated and need to be re-factored.

Take [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/) for example, version two was such a departure from version one that it required almost a complete re-write of your application in order to update to it. In comparison take [React JS](https://reactjs.org/), React has improved greatly since it's release in 2012, and though it has had many major updates and the approach of writing a React application has advanced immensely, updating to a later version has never been a struggle.

## My approach

#### Identifying what applications I want to create

This should be the easy part right? We all know what we want to create? Fortunately this is true in most peoples cases, we've all had a lot of experience to get to where we are and we know what we are interested in. The *what we're interested in* is very important, experience has taught me not to try and build something for myself unless I am both close to the subject matter and I am passionate about the solution. Simply put - Don't build something unless you would use it yourself.

If I look at myself and where I've come from I can identify easily with who I am and what I should be creating: I'm an artist at heart, I was always meant to do something with art. I've always liked urban stylistic art in the form of comics, graffiti, skate and surf art. I've always liked character design and take influence from urban artists such as [Pete Fowler](http://petefowlershop.com/) or [Shepard Fairey](https://obeygiant.com/). I am not a huge gamer, I used to be when I was younger but this has not transferred to my adult life, I do like the challenge of a short game and I like the graphics in some games but this is about as far as it goes. What I am interested in is new technology and it's application, on the one hand to wow the user, and on the other to provide users with exciting tools to enrich their lifestyle or that could help them to live a better or fuller life.

So I can take all these things along with my experience of creating other applications and throw them all into a melding pot, and from a personal point of view start to form the type of application/s I want to create. I see these as being:

- Utility applications that are exciting and possibly could improve users lives
- Interactive experiential applications that wow users

Bearing this in mind I can look at existing applications of this type and see that:

- **Utility applications that are exciting and possibly could improve users lives**: This type of application requires constant regular use, especially if the application is looking to *improve* or *enrich* peoples lives. An example of an enriching application might be [Map My Run](https://www.mapmyrun.com/) that allows it's users to better experience their hobby of running and in turn improve their fitness. This type of application would be useless without being mobile.
- **Interactive experiential applications that wow users**: This type of application is based on new emerging technology. By virtue of this it can have a limited lifespan and is often not something that gets everyday usage but rather it could be a high end technical piece to wow consumers at a trade show or TODO... 

Aside from what I want there needs to be some market evaluation in order to solidify my decision to embrace the path on which I am heading...
