## The brief

This week we are engaging in an *App Jam*; an extreme development practice that *celebrates risky experimentation, and spontaneous creativity*.

The task is to try and create a prototype for an application from beginning to end in only 48 hours; It is mentioned that the short time frame should force us to design a *very small but hopefully very interesting application*.

We should explore new ideas and concepts with hope to discover creativity within ones self and have fun trying out new and interesting ideas. It is mentioned that it's common to perhaps only discover bad ideas, but that we should not be disappointed if we learn only what does not work as failures are equally as important as successes, and we should look at these failings and learn what we need to do next to improve ourselves and our applications.

> Note: It is mentioned that Tim Schafer at Double Fine Studios in San Francisco who have created a range of well known games including Grim Fandango, Psychonauts & Broken Age use Game Jams to recognise and develop new intellectual property and many of their recent games originate from such Game Jams.

Finally mention is given to the importance of finding the time and the space to engage in this practice and that we should *take the activity seriously and plan ahead* if we are to be successful.

### Understanding the brief

This task is about practicing all aspects of creative application design and development; from ideation, to identifying a chosen idea, to developing that idea and illustrating this with wire frames or mock ups and finally using the right platform and tools in order to realise that idea and develop the idea as a prototype.

Understanding the time constraints are important; 48 hours is not long, the project will need to be managed effectively and broken apart to illustrate the different elements required in the overall task. I will need to time box each element effectively and stick closely to plan. In order to get the most from the task I should allocate larger blocks of time to be allocated when I have little distraction to maintain focus.

I should try to work quickly in the earlier stages of the task in order to leave more time for the production elements which are more time consuming. In order to uncover the best ideas I should allow myself to be spontaneous in brainstorming and not be fearful of allowing myself to experiment freely. To be more efficient, my mind maps and wire frames should be sketched and not polished and the design and prototyping framework should be selected accordingly for speed of delivery.

## My approach

Problem / solution approach

Theme / Story approach

Comprehensive research mission, learning about a topic and waiting for a design to emerge from the research process not appropriate, slow boil ideas, could use these: Cryptants?

Construct and test prototypes (see image grabbed) smaller (quick) and larger (slower) cycles, rapid and maximise cycles, reduce time required for each iteration, reduce time in testing to run quickly and maximise information in as short a time as possible, test in a concise and focused way, prototypes should be rough and ready in the early stages, paper prototypes, present in workflow for how the user interacts.

Test your apps and test user stories, see the wizard of oz approach, get user feedback. This is to iron out any flaws.

In the later stages create a digital prototype, an interactive sketch (InVision), then implement one core feature (vertical slice) of the application (sobriety test app for example)
