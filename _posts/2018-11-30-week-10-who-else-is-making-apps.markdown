## The brief

Write a 250-300 word post noting your progress so far. Identify one challenge and / or an obstacle and one SMART action to resolve the issue.

## My experience in week ten

The source material this week was focused on TODO...

Importance of communities of practice with regard to your learning and professional development

Analogue communities

• Communities I've been in:
  - React London Meet up - Great but hard to attend regularly after moving away from the city
  - BNI - Good for networking but not specific enough for the digital industry, in hindsight would likely have been more valuable to have sought something like the Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE) as noted in the source material this week, also they demanded quite a lot from you in terms of participation and I always found it a struggle to keep on top of this.

• Regularly attend events for networking (Tacit knowledge), always inspiring, come away thirsty to write code and with new ideas:
  - Blockchain Summit
  - React London

• Hire people and learn from them (Tacit knowledge):
  - Antiblanks community - Found it hard to make time for communities and the challenge for me is to find a community but having people around me who work for me are inspiring

Digital communities
  - Stack Overflow used regularly but not participated much in giving advice
  - Github used regularly, have numerous shared open source projects in the past such as [Kettle](https://github.com/Antiblanks/kettle.css.layout), a CSS layout library or various reusable plugins but I've done this less so lately due to strict NDA's for the clients we more recently work with
  - Monetary Unit (MUE) crypto currency https://www.monetaryunit.org, integration with the community and acceptance, struggled with finding the time required to make a difference and thus get accepted

Movements:
  - Hacker movement
  - Maker movement - Not as interesting to me
    - Maker spaces and hack spaces sounded interesting
  - Agile movement - Agile software development, Agile alliance

### Tying this to my project

• Been in plenty for networking and web development been in any for app development, need to do this, base do time constraints mentioned above and on the types of communities that have delivered a better experience for me...
  - Any communities for React Native?
    - https://www.meetup.com/React-Native-London
  - Any communities for Augmented Reality?
    - https://www.meetup.com/Augmenting-Reality

I’ve created a SMART action to ensure XYZ:

- **Making it Specific**: The goal is to XYZ
- **Making it Measurable**: TODO...
- **Making it Attainable**: TODO...
- **Making it Relevant**: TODO...
- **Making it Time-Based**: TODO...

## Summary

In the above post I've

• Briefly touched on the communities I've been involved in and the good and bad experiences I've had with these
• Went on to mention some of the noteworthy learnings from this weeks source material and how this has inspired me to seek new communities that are more relevant to app development
• Finally I've created a SMART action to regularly attend two meet ups that are relevant to my current practice
