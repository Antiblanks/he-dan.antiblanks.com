## My experience in week two

The source material this week was split over the design of fictional worlds and game mechanics.

The [Narrative Design video by Che Wilbraham](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-2-narrative-design-che-wilbraham?module_item_id=19025) introduced us to the term 'Interactive Narrative' and explained the design of this being to create a possible space (Story World) in which a player can act to create their own experience (Storyline). The video went on to outline the difference between Embedded and Emergent Narrative and how these terms relate to Interactive Narrative in that the Story World is formed of Embedded Narrative and the Emergent Narrative is tied more to the Storyline that the player creates. I found this to be very inspiring and above anything the video instilled the importance of narrative behind gameplay and creating stickiness within apps.

### Tying this to my project

Despite itching to throw myself into the development of Escape The App, I had planned to finish the app's business plan by the start of February so that I could begin pitching for investment by the middle or the end of the month. Despite being behind in achieving this SMART goal, I also acknowledge that the development required to bring the app to MVP release over the next eleven weeks (another of my SMART actions) is no mean feat in itself so to progress both I decided to split my production work this week 50/50 with aim to work more on the business plan and start also on the design of some key screens.

I began the design of the *Account*, *List Games* and *Play Game* screens based on my UX created over the Christmas break and initially I was pretty pleased with the results. However, this was before watching the Narrative Design video by Che Wilbraham, after this the app felt as though it was missing narrative completely and this was reflected in the graphics which now appeared to lack substance. I started thinking about the user types 'Escape Game Owners' and 'Escape Game Players'. Who were they? What was their story and why would they use the app? I started looking at [Zombies Run](https://zombiesrungame.com), an app that got mention during the last study block as a good example of a gamification app. I looked at the way they embed the narrative and how this plays a part in the apps stickiness. I spent a few hours brainstorming an overarching narrative for Escape The App and this is what I came up with:

> In 2012 real world social interactions were dying. Millennials were increasingly turning to their devices to socialise and play virtual games. Statistics showed that by 2021 all offline social interactions will have become extinct. As a last resort world governments formed a top secret underground movement to encourage offline social interactions through exciting Escape Games. This movement was known as Escape. By 2018 the Escape movement is proven to be working, offline social interactions have increased by 1000% but economical factors are forcing a clamp down on funding and yet again the survival of real world social interactions hangs in the balance. With no funding the fate of real world social interactions and Escape Gaming is now in the hands of the people. We are Escape, we are the revolution and we need you.

I then created a [task](https://trello.com/c/rFRCChKt/16-ux007-update-wireframes-for-the-v1-play-room-journey-to-introduce-narrative-4-hrs) to look at messaging within the *Play Game* journey to see if I can better embed the narrative to make the experience of playing an Escape Game more sticky.

The narrative learning also bled into my work on the business plan and enabled me to rethink the section titled 'How Escape The App Works'. I embedded the above narrative into this to make the content more engaging and I also ran over the entire plan to introduce the narrative throughout and bring more cohesion to each of the sections. Aside from the introduction of the narrative to the plan I also tackled three of the five missing sections including the marketing strategy, investment proposal and the product comparison. The investment proposal was taxing as I struggled to calculate an encouraging Return On Investment (ROI), this enforced a conclusion that despite being a good business, Escape The App is not an incredibly investable venture with only it's current monetisation strategy of selling subscriptions and advertisements to Escape Businesses. Feeling a tad deflated by this I decided to put the work to one side and focus on finding a product comparison. This was something I had expected to be tough as the app is quite unique in that it is *gamification of a game*, I wasn't wrong, I hit a brick wall trying to find a comparative companion app. Just before giving in I changed tact and started thinking of other competitive activities that have a thriving community and this eventually led me to Go-Karting and [RaceFacer](https://www.racefacer.com). This was a pleasing find, I was encouraged to find something that aligned so well and being well established and feature rich, it was also inspiring to see what Escape The App could become and gave me a hint toward bookings as a potential solution for improving monetisation and increasing the ROI. I created myself a [task](https://trello.com/c/r8AhyziU/29-mkt009-investigate-bookings-potential) to investigate taking bookings and another [task](https://trello.com/c/O0bbcGhD/30-mkt010-investigate-racefacer-as-a-product-comparison) to explore RaceFacer as a potential product comparison.

## Summary

TODO... Also, build a bit of game mechanic into the above...
