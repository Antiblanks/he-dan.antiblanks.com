## My experience in week three

The source material this week was a continuation on narrative design and introduced us to the term *Suspension of disbelief*.

The [Introduction Video by Alcwyn Parker](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-3-introduction?module_item_id=19033) sets the premise for a week of content designed to make us draw a link between theory and practice. There is mention of a term *Pure solutionism* (new to me), that was coined by Evgeny Morozov in his book 'To Save Everything, Click Here'. The term describes *the belief that all difficulties have benign solutions, often of a technocratic nature* and can refer to *the providing of a solution or solutions to a customer or client (sometimes before a problem has been identified)*. The term raised my interest as I've been guilty of making this mistake in the past within my own work and I've reflected on this as being an attributor to failure for one or more my applications. Parker summarises by highlighting the importance of audience research and how using research to inform your practice will inevitably lead to a higher quality of output. I completely agree and acknowledged the importance of research myself in this [post]({% post_url 2018-11-09-week-7-audience-research %}) within the previous study block as well as citing my own applications that have suffered from not completely understanding my customers and what they want.

The [Ergodic Literature Video by Dr Michael Scott](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-3-ergodic-literature?module_item_id=19037) explores the world of ergodic literature, a term coined by Espen Aarseth. Despite only short, the video is highly theoretic. There is introduction to *cyber texts* and *cybernetic narratives* as one form of Ergodic Literature that is described as narratives that change when we interact with them or *texts that change their form in response to some kind of logic*. We are introduced to *scriptons* being a part of a narrative that can be meaningfully conveyed and presented to the reader as a unit, and *textons* being a component part of this, usually a word or symbol that can be understood in isolation, but when strung together with other *textons*, will form a *scripton*. There is then some exploration into four layers of user functions - *interpretive functions* being interpretation based on the user's prior knowledge of context, *explorative functions* being the pathway the user takes and the order in which they experience scriptons, *configurative functions* being the decisions that are made by the user to dynamically manipulate the scriptons in the text and *textonic functions* being the calculations that directly manipulate textons themselves. This forms the theoretical premise for the next part of the video which describes how this applies in practice when related to the architecture of a game, particularly state variables that are manipulated by the user's decision making which then alter the cyber text. There is a juxtapositional demonstration of this using a scene taken from the game 'Mass Effect' which brings welcome context to the theory by showing two different eventualities and explaining the prior good and bad user decisions that led to the shape of state in each. Having built numerous games the concept of state and how state properties affect outcomes was not new to me but bringing some theory to this was hugely interesting.

The [Introduction to Ren'Py Video by Dr Michael Scott](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-3-an-introduction-to-renpy?module_item_id=19039) gives a concise introduction to [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org), a visual novel engine written in the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language that can be used to tell interactive stories. Though only my first preview of the tool, the setup instructions in the video were clear and concise and my varied programming experience helped me to get to grips with the program very quickly and from only a brief prelude into the workings of Ren'Py, I was able to see the power and versatility of this engine, and with it's basic and procedural syntax (much akin to writing a console app) it was easy to see why this tool is so widely adopted by aspiring Role Player Game (RPG) creators who are starting out and want to get into development quickly with little setup and configuration overhead. We were given a task to create an RPG using the engine which is covered in more detail in this [post]({% post_url 2019-02-14-week-3-create-an-interactive-novel %}). Though enjoyable learning something new, I'm not sure I would use the engine again for my own projects being it lacks the ability to deliver the type of application that interests me. However, saying that I can see the value in Ren'Py and being the previous [Long Live the Queen Case Study Video by Dr Michael Scott](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-3-long-live-the-queen-a-case-study?module_item_id=19038) gives a summary of the 'Long Live the Queen' game created using Ren'Py and the commercial success this had selling more than 350,000 units on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com) alone, one cannot ignore this framework and it's ability to deliver highly playable gaming experiences for which there is clearly a market.

The [Pursuing Interactive Suspension of Disbelief Video by Sean Vanaman](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/discussion_topics/8356?module_item_id=19040) referenced his work on [Telltale Game's](https://telltale.com) The Walking Dead and their new game Firewatch at his company Campo Santo explored the challenges encountered and techniques used in creating tonal, emotional, systemic and narrative consistency in the pursuit of suspending a player's disbelief. The video gives priceless insight into the speakers experience from working on the aforementioned games. There were some nice takeaways in the form of the speakers summarised component parts required to achieve suspension of disbelief, these being *believable characters*, *discoverable story* and *responsive systems* and statements about narrative design such as *stories about people help us to see past our disbelief in the text*, all of which were inspirational and made me deeper assess the construction and execution of narrative within my own project.



• Samuel Taylor Coleridge - Players shouldn't have to ignore certain aspects of the experience just to find narrative or connect to the story
• To do this:
  - Communicate with the player
  - Focus on the human experience
  - Worth engaging emotionally
• If you're on a date with the player:
  - Get to know them, listen to what they are saying
  - Return with comfortably predictable and excitingly surprising responses
• Dancing with the player
  - Effortless
  - Let the player lead you (check this, who leads?)
• Walking dead and where it failed
  - When the dialog was not as responsive - players eyes glaze, they are experiencing a story but not their story
• Tonal consistency
  - Real conversation
  - Building a relationship
  - Long list of things that will hinder this (see list)
  - Event manager working with speech manager and delivering correct dialog based on state

### Tying this to my project

• Pure solutionism
  - Reflection...

• State shapes and how this affects the cybernetic narratives
  - How to player decisions affect state and how does this state affect their emergent narrative

• User type and how this affects cybernetic narratives
  - Question up front: 'Are you an XXX or a YYY'

• Start looking as the gamification as a whole and not just the playable element
  - How to we build cybernetic narratives into this?...
  - Who communicates with the user? Who is this person? Think about tonal consistency and narrative cohesion etc
    - Real conversation
    - Building a relationship

• Suspension in disbelief
  - Stories about people help us to see past our disbelief in the text, how can we fine tune our narrative to introduce real people?
  - How to introduce the date scenario into this? Get to know them, listen to what they are saying (audience research) and then give them what they want
  - Think about the responses, the prompts and the hooks, these need to be tailored to the player, they need to feel like their experiencing their own story
  - Don't make it too complicated, make the CTA's easy so that the player can easily lead us through the experience

• Going too fast? Goals too lofty? Slow it down perhaps, more consideration in the game mechanics vs getting something into production that can be iterated on? Reading material always encourages me to put the brakes on, forcing me to think deeper about elements before rushing into implementation, was doing code but parked in favour of working creatively around the narrative and improve it using everything we've learned this week

• Good quote: 'A need in the field is ideas on how to create rooms that can be changed between plays in a fair manner, to both reduce cheating and allow people to replay the same game.' http://scottnicholson.com/pubs/stateofescape.pdf Could this inspire the narrative by adding an extra layer of play on  top of escape rooms? Tasks needing to be completed in a certain order etc?... How would we do this without jeopardising gameplay and could we police this? Also 'They found three things that players consistently enjoyed: being part of a
spectacle, feeling heroic, and engaging with something challenging (DuPlessie, 2013).' http://scottnicholson.com/pubs/stateofescape.pdf How can we promote players to feel heroic, badges? ranks? we need to put them up onto a pedestal when they complete a game and elevate that feeling of escaping.

• Reflection - This weeks source material and tasks to create the RPG with Ren'Py and the chapter review did seriously hinder my project sprint plan for the week and I did find it very hard to juggle the two in tandem. I've left myself a note to tackle this in the next webinar and parlay how much of the task work is relevant if it hinders my sprint. Being a firm believer in the adage that *Knowledge is Power* and knowing that the subscribed tasks are set as a means to inspire and improve my practice for which I can see great value the weight of these was a bit overpowering this week and it was disappointing to trade the time from that I wanted to spend working on my ongoing Escape app project. I do see the positive in this though, in that without being forced to undertake these tasks I would easily excuse them for not having the time, but sometimes I guess it's good to down tools and find inspiration as when I did finally get round to this [task](https://trello.com/c/qhtByuzX/31-ux008-devise-an-intro-to-introduce-the-narrative) to devise an intro to introduce the narrative for Escape The App, the content from this week, particularly parts of the talk given by Sean Vanaman and some of the analysis of J.R Tolkien's work in the chapter review did
