## My experience in week four

The source material this week was focused on colour theory and prompted us to think a bit more about what colours we use and why we use them.

The [Introduction Video by Alcwyn Parker](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-4-introduction?module_item_id=19050) sets the premise for *a week that aims to be as colourful as possible* and highlighted for us some of the areas we would be investigating such as the nature of colour, the human factors involved with colour perception, and colour theory, to help us make informed colour choices and speed up our design process. The video starts with a theoretical summary of colour and the way we perceive it and the importance of how we use it. There is a brief section on the differing meaning and acceptance of the same colours across cultures and the suggestion that colour is used to provoke emotion but that it is important to ensure we provoke the right emotions when using colour within our apps. I must say that none of this was new to me and having schooled in fine art and graphic design this served only to reiterate information that has pretty much become part of my subconscious by now. Saying this I was very interested to hear in the closing part of the video that Apple provide guidelines in how to use colour, I wasn't aware of this. Though again the points they raise seem with my experience to be second nature and almost common sense I enjoyed knowing they'd taken the time to provide such succinct guidelines.

The [Colour Theory Video by Alcwyn Parker](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-4-colour-theory?module_item_id=19054) expands on the introduction to give more scientific and theoretical insight into colour, from the physical properties of light, to the language and culture that form our understanding of colour. The video opens with a section on the science behind colour theory which I found to be very interesting, and I enjoyed learning more about the role of light in the portrayal of colour and how our perception of colour is based on the light that reflects off of an object. There is a section about colour modes with a description of both CMYK and RGB, both of which I am close too being I have a lot of experience in using both having traversed from print to digital design earlier in my career. There is then some detail on how a pixel works which I found to be eye opening and which filled some obvious gaps in my knowledge on how the screen produces colour using a red, green and blue light source. I found myself pondering how I'd not questioned this before being I've such long experience using RBG colours and having known the result had something to do with the screen being backlit. The video then moves to take a more theoretical stance, there is a section on colour interpretation that raises our awareness of [International Klein Blue (IKB)](http://www.todo.com), a deep blue hue first mixed by the French artist [Yves Klein](http://www.todo.com) who had a fascination with colour and explored the cultural impact on colour and theorised that appreciation of colour is a subjective experience that is unique to the individual. This section goes on to look at Hue, Saturation and Brightness (HSB) or as it can be know Hue, Saturation and Lightness (HSL) for which I've had some in-depth experience only recently when implementing custom HSL sliders in one of my applications [Plays](http://www.weareplays.com) to control the colour of text and pattern graphics. Next there is an introduction to the [Munsell colour system](http://www.todo.com) invented by Albert Henry Munsell who also had a fascination with colour but this time how we communicate, notate and document colour. I found this excerpt very interesting, I've lots of experience working with all aspects of colour in my design but I'd never come across the Munsell colour system nor the name of it's creator.
  - Colour wheel
    - Complimentary colours and theory behind different types of relationships including complimentary, near complimentary, double complimentary, split complimentary, triad, analogous and mutual complimentary
  - Josef Albers
    - Book Interaction of Colour

### Tying this to my project

• Introduction
  - Use of red, danger, want to create the drama in the animation, harbour the threat behind the narrative and leave the user feeling compelled to register. Talk about registration being a blocker, what percent get put off by registration etc?
  - Reference my decisions of colour based on the stuff in the introduction (Apple / Google, UX etc)

• Colour Theory
  - Though interesting, coming from a fine art background, having studied graphic design and worked as a designer for quite some time, colour choice is something that comes naturally to me and I would go as far to say that my colour decisions, though driven by theory are almost certainly subconscious at this point.
