## The brief

This week we've been tasked with the setup and configuration of the tools we need to start making applications. As stated in the introduction video we need to *identify a small selection of tools which will aid us in our field of interest*, and then we need to *set up and configure the tools we need to create an app*.

We should consider relevant languages, integrated environments, version control systems, software development kits (SDKs) for key platforms, and other computer aided software engineering systems.

We've been steered toward *picking the right tool based on the nature of the app/s we want to create*, and to *concentrate on the tools that are relevant to the apps we want to make*.

It is identified in the video that:

> The challenge is knowing you cannot master everything.

### Understanding the brief

The brief this week is incredibly assistive in guiding us through this task. The advice to pick the right tool based on the nature of the application/s you want to create is paramount and this should be the first thing to consider.

As it states, and as I am more than aware already, there are numerous platforms and tools to choose from. We've been given the hint *not to try and master everything*. This is a key statement that should resonate when approaching this task, being mindful of this throughout will prevent me getting caught in the trap of tinkering too much with different systems.

Another thing to consider is falling foul of focusing on the newest and coolest tech. I've seen it so many times in my career where developers can flit between technologies (and jobs) because they are driven by shiny new ways of doing things which are exciting. I understand it's exciting to work with a new technology but it's important to understand when a technology becomes viable for selection - By all means we should try out anything and everything as soon as it gets announced but we should be mindful of the fact that the technology we embrace will have *bugs*, will lack support documentation, and if that technology does stand the test of time (which it might not), will likely be re-versioned dramatically and improved so much that later versions are not backwards compatible and your application could quickly become outdated and need to be re-factored.

Take [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/) for example, version two was such a departure from version one that it required almost a complete re-write of your application in order to update to it. In comparison take [React JS](https://reactjs.org/), React has improved greatly since it's release in 2012, and though it has had many major updates and the approach of writing a React application has advanced immensely, updating to a later version has never been a struggle.

## My approach

In order to select the most relevant platforms and tools I've outlined the following structure:

#### Identifying what applications I want to create

I will look at my background, my likes and dislikes and influences with regard to applications that I use regularly and those that don't interest me. I will use my past experience in creating various applications of differing types to highlight specific areas that are most exciting to me and use statistics to evaluate the viability of my chosen application types within today's market place.

#### Identifying the right type of platforms and tools

I will look the the typical platforms and tools used to power the types of application I identify in the section above and seek to find a variant for each application type that I can consider for adoption.

#### Picking the right platforms and tools

I will look at the pros and cons of each of the platforms and tools short listed in the previous section with a view to select my preferred suite.

## The solution

#### Identifying what applications I want to create

This should be the easy part right? We all know what we want to create? Fortunately this is true in most peoples cases, we've all had a lot of experience to get to where we are and we know what we are interested in. The *what we're interested in* is very important, experience has taught me not to try and build something for myself unless I am both close to the subject matter and I am passionate about the solution. Simply put - Don't build something unless you would use it yourself.

If I look at myself and where I've come from I can identify easily with who I am and what I should be creating: I'm an artist at heart, I was always meant to do something with art. I've always liked urban stylistic art in the form of comics, graffiti, skate and surf art. I've always liked character design and take influence from urban artists such as [Pete Fowler](http://petefowlershop.com/) or [Shepard Fairey](https://obeygiant.com/). I am not a huge gamer, I used to be when I was younger but this has not transferred to my adult life, I do like the challenge of a short game and I like the graphics in some games but this is about as far as it goes. What I am interested in is new technology and it's application, on the one hand to wow the user, and on the other to provide users with exciting tools to enrich their lifestyle or that could help them to live a better or fuller life.

So I can take all these things along with my experience of creating other applications and throw them all into a melding pot, and from a personal point of view start to form the type of application/s I want to create. I see these as being:

- Utility applications that are exciting and possibly could improve users lives
- Interactive experiential applications that wow users

Bearing this in mind I can look at existing applications of this type and see that:

- **Utility applications that are exciting and possibly could improve users lives**: This type of application requires constant regular use, especially if the application is looking to *improve* or *enrich* peoples lives. An example of an enriching application might be [Map My Fitness](https://www.mapmyfitness.com/) that allows it's users to better experience their exercise and in turn improve their fitness. This type of application would be useless without being mobile.
- **Interactive experiential applications that wow users**: This type of application is based on new emerging technology. By virtue of this it can have a limited lifespan and is often not something that gets everyday use, but rather it could be a high end technical piece to wow consumers as an installation at a trade show or could be used as a technical piece on a feature film. An example of this type of application might be [The Audi Walking Virtual Reality (VR) experience](https://zerolight.com/projects/audi/audi-walking-vr/) created by [Zerolight](https://zerolight.com) that allows users to walk around and explore an Audi car, utilising the large *play area* of the HTC Vive.

Aside from what I want there also needs to be some market evaluation in order to solidify my decision to embrace the paths on which I am heading. The idea of shaping a career around what you like creating only works if consumers will buy the things you create. For this reason I am going to expand the above two examples as case studies:

**An enriching lifestyle application**

Map My Fitness was first launched in 2007, the project was funded over six rounds of investment totalling $23.7 million, it was acquired for $150 million in November 2013 by [Under Armour](https://www.underarmour.co.uk/en-gb/). At time of purchase the application had a reported 20 million registered users worldwide. Map My Fitness comprises of multiple cross platform mobile applications and supporting web applications.

**An interactive experiential application**

The Audi Walking VR experience was created for Audi by Zerolight in 2016 and was noted at the time as being *one of the best VR experiences from a brand seen so far*. It's obviously quite hard to identify exactly how much this application cost to create as companies are sensitive to giving away this type of information, but we can look at VR costs globally.

Based on research VR applications can take between 500-2000 hours to create with an average global day rate of $80-120 which yields a rough estimate of $40,000-200,000 per application.

I can back this up with personal experience and take an average of similar experience applications that we have created at [Antiblanks](http://www.antiblanks.com/) that have taken roughly 400 hours and carry a cost of roughly $40,000.

Considering these rates coupled with the growing adoption of VR worldwide and the fact that companies like Zerolight exist and are being scaled around this specialism does paint a very successful future for VR and VR experiences.

#### Identifying the right type of platforms and tools

Now that I've identified the type of application/s that I am interested in creating I can select the right platform and tools for the job. Again I will look at both application types but this time list the common platform and tools required to build these applications:

**An enriching lifestyle application**

This type of application is intended for high use across a range of devices. The project duration depends on the success of the application and it's traction and continual use in order to drive further investment. For these reasons the application will need to be available on multiple platforms including (at minimum) iOS, Android and online. Also the application will require constant updates for maintenance and to deliver new and engaging features, and this will result in a large amount of development.

In order to lower costs, maintain consistency and drive more features I should focus on cross platform scripting languages and tools for this type of application. Some of the languages/frameworks I will be considering are Angular JS or React JS with [PhoneGap (Apache Cordova)](https://phonegap.com/), [React Native](http://www.reactnative.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) and [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) with [Xamarin](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/). I will also be looking at the IDEs [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/), [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

**An interactive experiential application**

This type of application is often intended for specialised use within a controlled environment. Having control over the environment means that the distributor does not need to offer the application across a range of devices. The wow factor is key to the success of the application and this is achieved by using cutting edge technology and pushing the boundaries of it's capability. There is often a hardware integration involved, and in my past experience working with [Leo Associates](https://www.leoassociates.com/) what I've been told clients are looking for is:

> The next *big thing* in technology to make their installation stand out and create a talking point.

* Quote taken from Neil Smith, co-owner of Leo Associates.

In order to deliver applications of this nature I will be looking at current technologies including VR and Augmented Reality (AR). To create VR experiences I will need goggles such as those made by [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/) or the more cost effective [Samsung Gear VR](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/). I will need to consider the language and 3D engine used to power the experience and for this I will be looking at C# and [Unity](https://unity.com) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com).

#### Picking the right platforms and tools for cross platform development

Now that I've short listed an array of viable platforms and tools I am going to look at the pros and cons of each in order to select my final candidates for adoption.

**Angular JS or React JS with PhoneGap**

PhoneGap's main benefit is it's ease of use. If you are a web developer like myself, it's very easy to make a working application using tools that are very familiar (HTML, JavaScript & CSS). PhoneGap is also very quick to develop with, being that you are essentially developing a website to run in the devices in-application web browser then a lot of the Native complexities need not be considered.

The PhoneGap framework is also quite mature; it's first release was in 2011 and this means it will be stable, will likely not have any major rewrites, will be well documented and will be full featured.

However, one of PhoneGap's main strengths is also one of it's main weaknesses; running in the devices in-application browser results in a noticeable performance hit within the UI layer. If you're application is complex this affects the responsiveness of the UI, this is because all of the processing is taking place within the single UI thread.

In summary, PhoneGap is great for web developers who want to dip their feet into mobile application development. It's also a good option for experienced development teams to create prototypes or proof of concepts (POCs) to test a potential application or to add value in a pitch situation. But in my opinion, for the applications I want to build, there are better options available to me in this space.

**React Native**

React Native is very similar to PhoneGap in that, for web developers, it's very easy to make a working application using tools that are very familiar (HTML, or rather JSX, JavaScript & styling similar to CSS). However under the hood they are quite different; React Native is more advanced in the sense that the application it compiles down to is more native. Using iOS terminology to form an example, *React Native translates to Native UI components rather than WebView UI*. In layman terms this means that the application is not a website running in the devices in-application browser, but instead it is compiled to an actual native application.

This has many benefits, the main difference can be seen in the user experience; native applications are more responsive and are not hindered by the constraints of the in-application browser. Also, React Native, though written in JavaScript, supports multi-threading which enables you to run expensive background processes without impacting the rendering of your UI.

React Native does have some drawbacks: It is not all that mature, it was first announced by Facebook in 2015 so it is only three years old, the documentation is good however and there is support for most core components but based on experience upgrading to newer versions can be time consuming and we are still seeing regular feature deprecations. Saying that, the framework is stable and we at Antiblanks and other software houses have been using it to build production applications for some time.

In summary, React Native is a better option to PhoneGap I feel. From a personal point of view I know the framework well, I've always liked working with React and I can develop quickly with this technology. Also, despite being in it's infancy, given the success of React and how the Facebook team behind this has managed releases and maintained backwards compatibility in the main part, I am confident that React Native will be around for a long time and will not suffer any *major* breaking version alterations.

**C# with Xamarin**

Xamarin is built on top of the .NET framework. Xamarin was founded in 2011 but the framework was not adapted to compile to native iOS and Android until the release of Xamarin 2.0 in 2013. It was acquired in 2016 and is now owned and maintained by Microsoft. The fact that Xamarin is one of the more mature frameworks and is now owned and maintained by Microsoft speaks volumes about it's longevity.

> Saying this, a counter to this argument would be to reference the short lived and now deprecated [Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/). I think in this case though, that had more to do with web trends and the rise of mobile devices - Unless all device manufacturers are planning on getting together and adopting the same codebase for their native applications I don't think cross platform frameworks will be redundant any time soon!

Xamarin appeals to me for a number of reasons; for one, Xamarin compiles to a native application so performance is not hindered as with other frameworks already mentioned. Xamarin is written in C# which is a very robust and very mature language. At Antiblanks we have adopted a Linux, Apache, MySQL & PHP (LAMP) stack for our low budget web projects and we reserve .NET as our preferred framework for enterprise builds. With this in mind, I see C# very much as an enterprise language, it's very robust and it doesn't have many limitations. I am also well versed in C#, having written the language on and off for about seven years. There is also the inherent bonus of being able to use Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE which is a premium full featured IDE, and one of the best available on the market.

> A quick Google search for 'What is the best IDE' will return a number of results, most, if not all of which, feature Microsoft's Visual Studio at the very top of their recommendations.

All this aside, the only drawback for me is wading into unknown waters and learning a new framework when I have a fair number under my belt already. It's not that I am adverse to learning new frameworks and usually I jump at something new, but rather I am adverse to trading time spent creating a better application against the time it may take to get to grips with the setup. I need to consider this carefully and weigh this against my objectives and what I want from the course.

**Python with Kivy**

Kivy is a very much the wildcard option for me. At Antiblanks we've seen greater interest in customers looking for use to work on Python applications.   

#### Picking the right platforms and tools for experiential applications

TODO: Introduction...

**C# with Unity**

TODO...

**C++ with Unreal Engine**

TODO...

#### Picking the right back end scripting solution

None of the above are a one stop shop unfortunately...

#### Picking the right version control system

TODO: Bit about Git (version control)

## Conclusion

TODO:

The decision is actually really hard...

Bar PhoneGap they are all much the same in that they allow you to write the language you prefer and compile down to a native application...

Choose XXX because... Objectives, exiting with 2 partial IP's etc...

Hence the mix of platform and tools will be...

## What's next?...

TODO:

Note: This needs to be more about the platforms and the tools!

More scrutiny into the VR market place, investigation into offshore competition and whether this should be seen as a help or hinderance.

More scrutiny of IP vs service contracts: IP's - Benefit from offshore costs, service you are fighting with offshore costs

Moulding platforms and tools around an application and not just the type - Certain applications have technical challenges that might be easier solved by harnessing a different scripting language/framework.
