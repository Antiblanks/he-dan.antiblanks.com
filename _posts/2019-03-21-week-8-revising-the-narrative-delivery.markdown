I wasn't completely satisfied with the art in this [post]({% post_url 2019-03-08-week-6-photo-bashing %}) as the visual solution for delivering my narrative throughout game play. As a standalone piece of art the style worked but once I brought the art my application to design the first of the narrative screens that counts down to starting a game I found the visual to be quite jarring when in situ with the rest of the app.

TODO: Screen here...

TODO: So I tweaked the colour...

TODO: Experience has taught me that when wrestling with colour that there is most likely something more fundamentally wrong, coupled with the fact that the art does look out dated and overly filtered etc... I decided to go back tot he drawing board.

### The solution

TODO: Bit about how I arrived at the new solution here...

TODO: Screen here...

### Summary

TODO: Summarise and create action to being into build on Trello
