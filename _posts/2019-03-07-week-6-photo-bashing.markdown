In this post I'm going to experiment with some of the techniques given in the [Introduction to Digital Painting video by Phoebe Herring](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-5-phoebe-herring-introduction-to-digital-painting?module_item_id=19067) coupled with some techniques I've already learned working as a designer to create some artwork for the following screens to be used in Escape The App:

- **Countdown to starting a game**: When an escape game is selected for game play.
- **New clue available**: During game play when a new clue is available.
- **Confirm take clue**
- **Confirm quit game**
- **Successfully completing a game**
- **Failing to complete a game**

### My technique

My starting point is to find some backgrounds that suit my narrative. A quick brainstorm around historical revolutions, underground movements and escape games masters brings me to disused factory buildings and control rooms. Next I'm going to apply some filters. My years of experience working with Photoshop to artwork images for print media have taught me a few things about filters; primarily that they are very powerful tools that can be used to create some very cool effects but that overuse or misuse can easily result in very amateur looking artwork. To avoid this in my artwork for Escape The App I want to have a clear vision of what the artwork should look like before getting my hands dirty with the filters. I really like the work of Phoebe Herring, her style is fantastically polished and it lends itself perfectly to concept art, however the art I want to create is different.

Escape The App paints our modern world to be a dystopia created by us being slaves to our devices. *Escape* is the abandoned movement formed by the government that is now driven by the public. Being Escape is now an underground movement I want to draw inspiration from the art historically associated with movements or revolutions. The most prominent of course being the posterised propaganda art that is synonymous with The Cuban Revolution and war time poster art. I've added a few examples below:

You can see here that in all cases that the art is highly posterised, there is minimal use of colour (usually just three colours) and the associated colours are often red, white and black. The US based artist [Shepard Fairey](https://obeygiant.com) has modelled a very successful career on utilising his own modern vector based approach to creating this type of art to deliver profound modern propaganda and his art has also been used decoratively by big name clients including Led Zeppelin. I've added a few examples of his art below:

What I want to try and do is to find a series of techniques in Photoshop that I can utilise together to quickly create art that is stylistically similar to the above examples and the following is the approach I've taken to achieve this:

**Applying a Dry Brush filter**

Filters > Artistic > Dry Brush > (Brush size: 2, brush detail: 8, Texture: 1)

To get the artistic painted feel

The Dry Brush filter in the Photoshop Filter Gallery gives a good base paint effect, this can be used to make t

**Applying a Halftone Pattern filter**

Filters > Sketch > Halftone pattern > (Size: 1, contrast: 8)

To get the black and white poster look

**Applying a Cutout filter**

Filters > Artistic > Cutout > (Number of levels: 8, edge simplicity: 4, edge fidelity: 2)

To get the distinct colour separation and move the image toward a more vectorised illustration
