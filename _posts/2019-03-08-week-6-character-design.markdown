Character task here: [post]({% post_url 2019-03-07-week-6-games-master-characters %}) surfaced two games master characters [TODO: Male games master name] and [TODO: Female games master name]...

Now I've a better understanding of what my games master characters look like I've revisited the task from week five as I suggested I would in this [post]({% post_url 2019-03-01-week-5-concept-art %}) and utilised the techniques learned from Phoebe Herring to create polished art for the aforementioned Escape The App screens. The completed artworks can be seen in this [post]({% post_url 2019-03-01-week-5-concept-art %}).
