As I indicated in my progress report during the last module, the design style of Escape The App looked somewhat dated when compared to 2019 design trends as portrayed in this blog post titled ‘XYZ’ on ‘ABC’. I compared my app to several contemporary design-led apps, and one example I gave was the Apple Activity app that I noted as having a similar colour palette but as being more on-trend with its lack of photo-real imagery, generous use of negative space and soft bevelled edges, which was in contrast to my app design which had a lot of photo-real imagery, was quite busy in places and was more harsh with rife use of sharp edges throughout the UI.

Taking inspiration from the Apple Activity app, and other successful gamification apps such as Nike Run Club, and being led by contemporary design trends, in an effort to make my app look less dated I set about reviewing my design to make it more modern. Here are the results:

### General

• Change font - Make more rounded
• Introduce colour weighting to text to create hierarchy
• Increase line height
• Add more negative space where possible
• Round edges on buttons
• Remove form item labels and rely on placeholders

### Intercom

• Remove the logo
• Reduce size of intercom speaker

### Games

• Shorten text on sentences containing '& you'll climb to rank ...'
• Alter primary game list item to make image container round and position to left

### Home

• Remove 'See all' buttons for played and escaped games and just have large number which is clickable
• Remove 'Suggested games' title
• Replace primary game list item in suggested games with secondary list item
• Make the played and escaped games much more prominent
• Lose the grey background

### Conclusion

I’m much happier with the new look of Escape The App, I feel that all aspects of the design from scaling back the use of photo-real imagery, adding more negative space, softening edges on all the UI elements and the choice of font have worked together to achieve a style which is much more on trend. Also as a by-product of looking at other gamification apps to review the design style of my app, I’ve been prompted to consider the information hierarchy and the resulting UI in my app is much more considered and favours up-weighting statistics which are as I’ve learned more important to gamers such as (in the case of Escape The App) the users played and escaped games on the landing screen, or the effect on the users rank of escaping a game.
