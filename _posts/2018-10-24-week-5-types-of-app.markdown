## The brief

Write a 250-300 word post noting your progress so far. Identify one challenge and / or an obstacle and one SMART action to resolve the issue.

## My experience in week five

The source material over this week is focused on the different types of application and about the importance and relevance of market research. I found both areas to be very useful:

### Types of application

Though I knew already what types of application I want to create, I wasn't perhaps aware of the exact terms by which they are identified. Knowing the common name for these categories will enable me to perform more focused market research and competitor analysis for my ideas. To clarify at this point and to tighten my loose description of the types of app I'm interested in creating that were first mentioned in this [post]({% post_url 2018-10-03-week-2-setup-of-platform-and-tools %}), I can establish that I am most interested in creating *Serious Game* and *Gamification* applications with potential cross over into *eHealth / mHealth*.

### Market research

The source material related to market research over this week stands to affirm my already clear understanding of the importance of performing market validation on my application ideas before developing them. Though I was aware of a lot of the content and I have already been practicing most of the techniques raised, the material has helped me to refine my research into a more structured approach and has raised my awareness of a few tips and techniques. Off the back of this I've created a basic checklist below that I will apply to all of my app ideas before developing further past the ideation stage:

-


- **Markets and segmentation**:

identified a need to flex some of the market research techniques raised to improve the way I currently validate my application ideas.



- **Looking for trends**: I hadn't identified this as being a useful starting point for ideating
- **Serious game submission criteria in the Apple App Store**: I wasn't aware of the difficulties I would face in getting approval for a *Serious Game* in the Apple App Store. Being this is one of my favoured application types I need to have a thorough understanding of the criteria and be mindful of this when developing my ideas.


## Summary

In this post I've clarified the common names for the types of application that I am interested in creating. I've also demonstrated my understanding of the importance of market research in creating successful applications, and I've outlined a checklist to test my application ideas for market viability that has then been used as the basis for a SMART action to ensure all of my application ideas are validated.
