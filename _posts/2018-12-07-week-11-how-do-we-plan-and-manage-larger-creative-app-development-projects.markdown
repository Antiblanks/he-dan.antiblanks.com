## My experience in week eleven

The source material this week was focused on XYZ

TODO: Current experience & how I can relate to this...

• Waterfall examples?

• Bloom.fm first introduction to agile methodologies
  - Influences from both Scrum and Kanban
  - Loose, not hugely rigid
• My Perfect Volkswagen
  - Scrum
  - Refined further, true agile, more rigid
    - Backlog, sprint planning team & client (planning poker), 2 week sprint, sprint review with team & client (deploy, preview, progress weighed [velocity]), sprint retrospective team no client (well? wrong? improved?)
• Falabella
  - Somewhere in the middle, paved the way for how I manage projects today

• Audio?

• Graphics?

• Videos?

TODO: What if anything this weeks content has taught me...

• Traditional Waterfall approach to the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
• Scrum approach to the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
• Audio for apps and games
  - Clipping, layering
  - Recording in RAW with Zoom HD
  - Editing Logic Pro, Pro Tools, Studio 1
  - Outputting as WAV, more transferrable, mindful of good quality and low file size for mobile
• Graphics for apps and games
  - Commissioning, licensing, royalty free, asset creation (digital painting etc)
  - Two kinds of graphics
    - Raster - Array of pixels (Photoshop)
    - Vector - Geometrics (Illustrator)
  - File formats
    - Raster compression
      - Lossy - JPG, do not reproduce the original image (pixelated, smaller)
      - Lossless - PNG, reproduce the original image (cleaner, bigger)
    - Vector compression
      - SVG
  - Colour
  - Importing & rendering (displaying)
• Videos for apps and games
  - Creating videos
    - Premier
    - AE
    - Photoshop (type)
    - Auditions (sound)
    - Prelude (asset management)
  - Creative cloud
    - Dynamic linking - Changes between programs
  - Acquisition
    - Canon 5D
      - Not great for motion
    - Sennheiser audio mic
    - Video & sound checks
    - Levels (in Auditions)
      - Clear environmental factors, remove background noise
  - Organisation
    - Good folder structure
    - Asset linking
    - Nest assets within root project folder
  - Media encoding
