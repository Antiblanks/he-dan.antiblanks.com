## My experience in week five

The source material this week was focused on concept art as a means of testing assumptions, communicating ideas and perfecting the look and feel of our designs.

The [Introduction Video by Alcwyn Parker](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-4-introduction?module_item_id=19050)

• An initial stage in game art development, used to convey an idea before it is fully implemented.
• It is a great way of testing or experimenting with ideas and getting a better feel for what you are trying to design, before you spend hours and hours creating the final assets.
• In this week you explore a variety of core techniques and practices used to create art for games.
• Concept art is as much about research as it is about fast generation of visual ideas, speed over execution.
• Painting, drawing, modelling all are not enough, without a solid understanding of design and a good sense of storytelling.
• Don’t get overwhelmed by the concept art you see out there in the wild. Instead, understand the context in which you are viewing it.

The work of [Phoebe Herring](https://phoebeherring.com) and the [Introduction to Digital Painting video by Phoebe Herring](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-5-phoebe-herring-introduction-to-digital-painting?module_item_id=19067)

• Used today for promotional art within games and concept art
• Concept art is used to get design concepts worked up quickly before creating 3D models
• Basics of drawing / painting with a Wacom tablet and some tips on moving around the canvas
• Basics of setting up Photoshop to use for painting, swatches and palette selection, brushes and brush selection
• TODO...

### Tying this to my project

• The design style for Escape The App is very flat and vector based, I never had any intention to introduce 3D models or video into the app as it wouldn't suit the creative direction, however I have been looking for an artistic style to create visual stills to embed parts of narrative throughout my application. I've always been a fan of the look achieved with rotoscoping in the film [A Scanner Darkly](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296) and the drawing style of Phoebe Herring is not too dissimilar and I'd quite like to experiment with utilising the learned photo bashing techniques to drive these.

• The task this week was to create a piece of concept art that illustrates a situation where your main app concept might be used. I've chosen to twist this a little to directly support the development of Escape The App and instead I'm going to attempt to create one or two images that will be used to deliver parts of the narrative before and after game play, these being:

- **Countdown to starting a game**: On this screen the virtual games master TODO...
- **Successfully completing a game**: On this screen the virtual games master TODO...
- **Failing to complete a game**: On this screen the virtual games master TODO...

You'll see that I've mentioned the 'virtual games master' in all three of the above parts of narrative, this is the character I hinted toward exploring in this [post]({% post_url 2019-02-17-week-3-suspension-of-disbelief %}). I realise I'm getting slightly ahead of myself here in creating art for these screens being that I need to better understand the virtual games master character/s first before I tackle this so for this reason I will revisit this task after completing the character design work.
