## The brief

This week is all about critical reflection and analysis of my progress on the course so far.

## Understanding the brief

The brief this week needs far less analysis than that of the previous weeks. The task is simply to reflect on my progress and formulate a SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based) plan in order to achieve my goals.

A SMART plan is not something that is new to me as I do, although not formally documenting it, regularly adopt this approach with my business partner when analysing the current direction of our company *Antiblanks* in order to devise time based plans and objectives that help us with our decision making.

## My approach

This task has come at just the right time for me, I've had an eye opening introduction to the course over the last three weeks and my experience on the *App Jam* detailed in this [post]({% post_url 2018-10-10-week-3-app-jam %}) has caused me to deeply analyse my goals and my approach to achieving them.

The brief actually states that we should identify one challenge and / or obstacle and propose a SMART action to overcome it. I am going to look at this more holistically; I faced various challenges in the *App Jam* but these helped me to see clearly the over arching issues that I need to overcome in order to get what I want.

I will start by briefly outlining my long-term goal that I had predefined before joining the course. I am then going to summarise my experience over the last three weeks and detail what I've learned and how, if at all, these learnings affect these goals in order to settle on my approach. And finally I will outline a short but concise SMART plan in order to achieve my goal.

> SMART is about identifying goals and then devising a plan to achieve these. The methodology relies on five steps: 1. Making it Specific, 2. Making it Measurable, 3. Making it Attainable, 4. Making it (the goal) Relevant and 5. Making it Time-Based.

## My predefined goals

My main goal throughout this course, other than to gain the accreditation of course, is to exit with at least one intellectual property (IP) that we can further and bring to market at *Antiblanks*. I want the course to help reignite my creativity and identify a really strong idea that I can then apply my years of industry experience to and make a success of it.

Fortunately this goal hasn't changed as a result of anything I've learned so far and to be honest I am quite sure that I won't diverge from this.

## My experience so far

The creative piece in week one was incredibly valuable for me. It fulfilled part of what I was looking for from the course; reigniting my creativity was almost immediate and thankfully I realised that I hadn't lost it at all, it's just that I don't make enough time to be creative. Not having any *great* ideas was an issue that I had already identified as being a blocker to creating a successful IP.

My creativity used to be unstoppable, I would frequently find my imagination running away with itself and I was wondering what had changed. It's now very apparent that this has been caused by my lack of free time; I am so busy all the time now that my mind is not left idle to wonder.

I don't think I can fix this, given my responsibilities, but week one affirmed for me that I need to set time aside to be creative and reminded me that there are ways to kick start the creativity if it doesn't come readily.

The platforms and tools task in week two was less interesting - Having been at this game for a long time I know my tools already so from the outset I wasn't particularly excited about the prospect of delving into this. Saying this, I did enjoy weighing up the options and exploring alternative solutions despite settling back into my previously preferred stack.

In hindsight I do realise that I actually misused this time; I spent countless hours writing a detailed journal post that, though interesting, did really just stand to confirm what I already knew. What I should have done with this week, rather than looking for alternatives was to trust my experience and spend my time focusing on a technology that I hadn't yet worked with but I knew was something I wanted to explore: Setting up a React Native / iOS / Android boilerplate with Augmented Reality (AR) integrated would have been perfect for this time. I would have enjoyed the task more and I would have been set to hit the ground running come the App Jam.
