In this post I've attempted to create synthesised sounds for both my logo, for use on the splash screen of Escape The App, and to notify users that a clue has been made available, for use during game play. I have to admit that I was a little daunted before undertaking this task as creating my own sounds is something I'd never done before, however my thinking was to approach this in the same way I would approach a visually creative task, which is to clarify the requirement and brainstorm solutions and see what happens as a consequence. Before I got into the creative part of the task I thought I would experiment a little with what's achievable so that I knew what I was working with and how to create sound in the first place.

### Experimenting with sound creation

I decided to experiment using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) as it's a program I am reasonably familiar with and I wanted to limit the steepness of my learning curve by not adding a new piece of software into the mix being that synthesised sound creation alone is a new concept to me and taking on the two together might be too much. I found this useful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ngGaYIzvsU) on YouTube that I coupled with some of the information on the [BBC Radiophonic Workshop Video](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-8-bbc-radiophonic-workshop?module_item_id=19103) to help me to understand how to start forming sound using tones. To summarise my experimentation I created six tones using a sine waveform with varying frequency and amplitude and experimented with what sounds could be achieved by soloing each track and editing the waveform using the envelope tool. Here's a grab of my tracks taken at some point during my experimentation:

I didn't need to play for long before I felt that I had enough to go back to the drawing board and brainstorm the type of sound I wanted for both my logo and my notification and then *attempt* to create these sounds using this technique in Audacity. At this point, if I am honest, I wasn't completely confident that I would create something production ready but I thought I'd give it a go regardless.

### Creating sound for my logo

For this sound I brainstormed the Escape The App brand and thought deeply about the story world I'm creating with my narrative.

### Creating sound to notify users that a clue has been made available
