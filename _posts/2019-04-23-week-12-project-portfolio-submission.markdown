### Codebase

The codebase for Escape The App is hosted on Github [here](https://github.com/Antiblanks/antiblanks.escape.reactnativeapp). Being that Escape The App is an Intellectual Property of Antiblanks the repository has been made private, to access the repository you will need to be added as a collaborator on the project. To be added as a collaborator please email me using [this link](mailto:dan.ivanovic@antiblanks.com?subject=Request to collaborate on Escape The App) and provide your Github username.

### Prototype

Escape The App will eventually be released as a cross platform application for both iOS and Android with support for all major devices. Though this is the eventual intention the app has currently only been configured and tested on iOS version 10+ and on the iPhone 6s and newer devices. The app has not yet been configured for older devices such as the iPhone 4/5 which eventually will be required to run the app on compatibility mode on the iPad.

For purpose of this submission the prototype will be available for testing on TestFlight. To get an invite to test the app please email me using [this link](mailto:dan.ivanovic@antiblanks.com?subject=Request to test Escape The App on TestFlight) and provide the email that is tied to your Apple ID.
