## The brief

This week we are engaging in an app jam; an extreme development practice that *celebrates risky experimentation, and spontaneous creativity*.

The task is to try and create a prototype for an application from beginning to end in only 48 hours; It is mentioned that the short time frame should force us to design a *very small but hopefully very interesting application*.

We should explore new ideas and concepts with hope to discover creativity within ones self and have fun trying out new and interesting ideas. It is mentioned that it's common to perhaps only discover bad ideas, but that we should not be disappointed if we learn only what does not work as failures are equally as important as successes, and we should look at these failings and learn what we need to do next to improve ourselves and our applications.

> Note: It is mentioned that Tim Schafer at Double Fine Studios in San Francisco who have created a range of well known games including Grim Fandango, Psychonauts & Broken Age use Game Jams to recognise and develop new intellectual property and many of their recent games originate from such Game Jams.

There is mention given to the importance of finding the time and the space to engage in this practice and that we should *take the activity seriously and plan ahead* if we are to be successful.

Finally, there is a theme for the app jam which has been selected using Verb, Noun & Adjective (VNA) ideation cards and this is *Guide, Opponent, Restricted*.

### Understanding the brief

This task is about identifying ideas and validating them through rapid prototyping and eventually developing a stronger idea into a more polished prototype.

In order to uncover better ideas I should allow myself to be spontaneous in brainstorming and not be fearful of allowing myself to experiment freely.

I should try to work in cycles to ideate, select an idea, and then construct prototypes to validate the idea. I should select methods that enable me to reduce the time required for each iteration and maximise the number of cycles I can complete in order to fail quickly and move on. Anything I can do to reduce time in validating an idea early will help me to arrive at a stronger end piece. To be more efficient, my mind maps, wire frames and early prototypes should be sketched and not polished and I should test in a concise and focused manor.

Understanding the time constraints from the outset are important; 48 hours is not long, the project will need to be managed effectively and broken apart to illustrate the different elements required in the overall task. I will need to time box each element effectively and stick closely to plan. In order to get the most from the task I should allocate larger dedicated blocks of time where I have little distraction to maintain focus.

## My approach

As established above I will look to work in cycles formed of the following tasks:

- **Ideation**: (2 hours) Brainstorm and create mind maps to highlight potential ideas based on the theme. I will use a combination of the *problem & solution* and *theme and story* approach to ideating.
- **Selecting an idea**: (1 hour) Select a stronger idea and create a mind map to explore the idea further.
- **Sketching & paper prototyping**: (1 hour) Sketch rough wire frames of key screens to form user journeys and present these to show how the user would interact.
- **Critiquing the paper prototyping**: (1 hour) Test the idea by walking through the paper prototype with an impartial third party and gathering feedback.
- **Sketched digital prototyping**: (4 hours) Take the sketches into prototyping software such as [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) and create an interactive prototype to illustrate a vertical or horizontal slice of the application.
- **Designed digital prototyping**: (6 hours) Convert the sketches into more polished art work using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and import these into the InVision prototype.
