Working from the idea that a revolutionary today to best connect with my target market of ages 16-30 and 30+ would be a social influencer or micro influencer and inspired by Roman Dlapa's suggestion that female characters are *usually avatars of an adventure, where justice and adventure are the strongest motivational points you may find in fictional characters*, I'm going to make my first games master a female and I'm going to take inspiration for her look and dress from modern twenty-something year old social influencers and couple this style with that of historical revolutionaries such as Che Guevara and the typical combat look that is often associated with leaders of a revolution. I started by doing some research on Google on social influencers and I found a few female looks that felt in keeping with what I have in mind:

Admittedly these images look like they've been taken from a fashion shoot but I guess that's going to be the case when you're dealing with young female social influencers. One thing I immediately noticed is that the majority of these females have dyed red hair. I didn't look for females with red hair specifically but my search evolved to single out a look I now know to be *Street Style Punk* and it appears dyed hair is synonymous with this style. I arrived at *Street Style Punk* because of the tie in this style has with combat clothing and you can see this in the first image with the khaki combat style jacket and the combat style leather boots which we associate with revolutionaries though these have a more modern and more hip / young twist. I like the round dark sunglasses worn by the female in the second image, I think these would add a certain anonymity to the character and I would expect this from an underground revolutionary who might want to move around unnoticed. The third and fourth images are a little too cool and mainstream for my liking. The majority of my SOM are intelligent geeky types and I think a character who's a bit more left field will be more relatable to them. In summary I think I most favour the looks of the subjects in the first and second images so I will construct my character using one of these images as a basis and then build her up utilising some photo bashing techniques.

**The raw image**

I've started by cutting out a female from one of the above images. I've opted for using the female in the second image as the quality is better and she's faced to the front which is easier to work with.
