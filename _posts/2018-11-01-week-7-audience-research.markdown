## The brief

Write a 250-300 word post noting your progress so far. Identify one challenge and / or an obstacle and one SMART action to resolve the issue.

## My experience in week seven

The source material this week takes a deeper look into audience research. This was the first time on the course I felt the content referenced an area where I have very little to no experience and it has caused me to question why.

Once I took the time to assess this, I realised that the reason for this is largely due to the bulk of my industry experience having been on the creative and technical side; I started as a designer, then a technician, then a technical lead and more recently a technical project manager and technical director. When you consider my career path it's not hard to see that it's the creative and technical areas where I have most experience and this is because these are the areas that interest me most.

When I've worked within an agency model, more often than not there is someone else, even a whole other department who is responsible for undertaking the audience research and by the time the idea gets to me it's quite mature from a UX / UI perspective and my role is more about architecting the best technical solution for the wires and designs that I've been given.

When I've worked on a single product focused team like [Bloom.fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom.fm) for example, there was certainly more exposure from a high level in what is going on outside of the technical side of things, and to a degree I did get some insight into audience research, but I didn't see the scale required. I see now that when it comes to my own creations I've done too little to validate the idea and far too little when it comes to involving a wider audience to develop the idea. This is because, quite frankly, it doesn't interest me, in the past I've just wanted to start working on the creative and technical parts as this is the bit I enjoy. This is a huge problem and something I really need to fix.

TODO: Could fix by hiring someone but always good to have some understanding of each part of the process.

### Tying this to my project

I've created the following SMART action to support this:

- **Making it Specific**: ??
- **Making it Measurable**: ??
- **Making it Attainable**: ??
- **Making it Relevant**: ??
- **Making it Time-Based**: ??
