## My experience in week three

The source material this week was...

• [Introduction video](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-4-introduction?module_item_id=19050)
  - This week aims to be as colourful as possible as we investigate the nature of colour, the human factors involved with colour perception, and colour theory, to help you make informed colour choices and speed up your design process.
  - Apple stuff
  - Google stuff
  - Having built many apps this is not new etc...

• [Colour Theory video](https://falmouthflexible.instructure.com/courses/296/pages/week-4-colour-theory?module_item_id=19054)
  - Alcwyn Parker explores colour in great depth; from the physical properties of light, to the language and culture that form our understanding of colour.
  - Science behind colour theory (Interesting)
    - Light and it's role in the portrayal of colour
    - Visible spectrum, electro-magnetic spectrum visible to the human eye
    - Light reflected off an object is the colour we perceive
  - Colour modes
    - CMYK, cyan, magenta, yellow and key (print)
    - RGB, red, green and blue (screen)
  - How a pixel works
    - Each pixel has a red, green and blue light source
    - Additive and subtractive colour mixing
  - Colour interpretation
    - International Klein Blue (IKB) - deep blue hue first mixed by the French artist Yves Klein
    - Cultural impact on colour, how different cultures interpret colour
    - Subjective experience, unique to the individual
  - HSB (hue, saturation, brightness), also known as HSL (hue, saturation, lightness)
    - Lots of experience, reference the Plays app [screen shot]
    - Munsell colour system, Albert Henry Munsell
      - American painter, teacher of art, and the inventor of the Munsell color system.
      - Fascination of colour, specifically how we communicate, notate and document colour
  - Colour wheel
    - Complimentary colours and theory behind different types of relationships including complimentary, near complimentary, double complimentary, split complimentary, triad, analogous and mutual complimentary
  - Josef Albers
    - 

### Tying this to my project

• Introduction
  - Use of red, danger, want to create the drama in the animation, harbour the threat behind the narrative and leave the user feeling compelled to register. Talk about registration being a blocker, what percent get put off by registration etc?
  - Reference my decisions of colour based on the stuff in the introduction (Apple / Google, UX etc)

• Colour Theory
  - Though interesting, coming from a fine art background, having studied graphic design and worked as a designer for quite some time, colour choice is something that comes naturally to me and I would go as far to say that my colour decisions, though driven by theory are almost certainly subconscious at this point.
