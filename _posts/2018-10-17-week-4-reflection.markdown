## The brief

This week is all about critical reflection and analysis of my progress on the course so far.

## Understanding the brief

The brief this week needs far less analysis than that of the previous weeks. The task is simply to reflect on my progress and formulate a SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based) plan in order to achieve my goals.

A SMART plan is not something that is new to me as I do, although not formally documenting it, regularly adopt this approach with my business partner when analysing the current direction of our company *Antiblanks* in order to devise time based plans and objectives that help us with our decision making.

## My approach

This task has come at just the right time for me, I've had an eye opening introduction to the course over the last three weeks and my experience on the *App Jam* detailed in this [post]({% post_url 2018-10-10-week-3-app-jam %}) has caused me to deeply analyse my goals and my approach to achieving them.

The brief actually states that we should identify one challenge and / or obstacle and propose a SMART action to overcome it. I am going to look at this more holistically; I faced various challenges in the *App Jam* but these helped me to see clearly the over arching issues that I need to overcome in order to get what I want.

I will start by briefly outlining my long-term goal that I had predefined before joining the course. I am then going to summarise my experience over the last three weeks and detail what I've learned and how, if at all, these learnings affect these goals in order to settle on my approach. And finally I will outline a short but concise SMART plan in order to achieve my goal.

> SMART is about identifying goals and then devising a plan to achieve these. The methodology relies on five steps: 1. Making it Specific, 2. Making it Measurable, 3. Making it Attainable, 4. Making it (the goal) Relevant and 5. Making it Time-Based.
