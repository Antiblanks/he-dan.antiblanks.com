So this is it! Day number one of the highly anticipated masters degree. My first task is to setup a blog. The course suggests using either Wordpress or [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as the blogging engine. Wordpress is something I know all too well so in favour of learning some new skills I've opted to try Github Pages instead.

Github Pages is built on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is built in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and as a stack, that sounded more modern so I thought I would experiment and this is the result.

It's a work in progress [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site using a light adaptation of the default `minima` theme. Currently it's not very attractive but as time goes on I will improve various elements to improve both the structure and design.

Watch this space!
